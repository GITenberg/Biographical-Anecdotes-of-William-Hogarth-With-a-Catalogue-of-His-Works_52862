<h2><a id="MEMORANDUM"></a>MEMORANDUM.</h2>


<p>Respect and gratitude having engaged
me to compile a memoir of my
deceased Master and Patron Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowyer</span>,
in the same performance I included anecdotes
of all the eminent persons any way
connected with him. A note of about a
page's length was allotted to <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>.
While it was printing, Mr. <span class="smcap">Walpole's</span>
Fourth Volume on the subject of English
Painters came out, and was followed by
an immediate rage for collecting every
scrap of our Artist's designs. Persevering
in my enquiries among my friends,
I had now amassed so much intelligence
relative to these engravings, that it could
no longer be crowded into the situation
originally meant for it. I was therefore
advised to publish it in the form of a sixpenny
pamphlet. This intended publication,
however, grew up by degrees into
a three-shilling book, and, within a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
and a half afterwards, was swelled into
almost its present bulk, at the price of six
shillings. Such was the origin and progress
of the following sheets, which, with
many corrections, &amp;c. have now reached a
Third Edition.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 25em;"><i>J. N.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Nov.</i> 10, 1785.</p>

<h3><a name="ADVERTISEMENT" id="ADVERTISEMENT">ADVERTISEMENT</a></h3>

<h4>TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h4>


<p>The author of these imperfect sheets cannot
present them a second time to the world, before he
has expressed his gratitude for the extreme candour
with which they have been treated by the <i>Monthly
Reviewers</i>. If <i>J. N.</i> has not availed himself of all
the corrections designed for his service, it is because
the able critic who proposes them has been deluded
by intelligence manifestly erroneous. <i>J. N.</i> received
each particular he has mentioned, in respect to the
assistance bestowed on <i>Hogarth</i> while his <i>Analysis</i> was
preparing, from Dr. <i>Morell</i>, a gentleman who on that
subject could not easily mistake. Implicit confidence
ought rather to be reposed in a literary coadjutor to
the deceased, than in any consistory of females that
ever "mumbled their wisdom over a gossip's bowl."
Authors rarely acquaint domestic women with the
progress of their writings, or the proportion of aid
they solicit from their friends. If it were needful
that Dr. <i>Morell</i> should translate a <i>Greek</i> passage<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for
<i>Hogarth</i>, how chanced it that our artist should want
to apply what he did not previously understand? I
must add, that the sentiments, published by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
<i>Reviewer</i> concerning these <i>Anecdotes</i>, bear no resemblance
to the opinion circulated by the cavillers with
whom he appears to have had a remote connection.
The parties who furnished every circumstance on
which he founds his reiterated charges of error and
misinformation, are not unknown. Ever since this
little work was edited, the people about Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>
have paid their court to her by decrying it as
"low, stupid, or false," without the slightest acknowledgement
for the sums of money it has conducted
to <i>The Golden Head</i> in <i>Leicester Fields</i>. While
the talents of the writer alone were questioned by
such inadequate judges of literary merit, a defence
on his part was quite unnecessary. He has waited,
however, with impatience for an opportunity of
making some reply to their groundless reflections on
his veracity. This purpose he flatters himself will
have been completely executed after he has observed
that all credentials relative to his disputed
assertion shall be ready (as they are at this moment)
for the Reviewer's inspection. <i>J. N.</i> cannot indeed
dismiss his present advertisement without observing,
that though the amiable partialities of a wife may
apologize for any contradiction suggested by Mrs.
<i>Hogarth</i> herself, the <i>English</i> language is not strong
enough to express the contempt he feels in regard
to the accumulated censure both of her male and
her female Parasites.</p>

<h3><a name="ADVERTISEMENT_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION" id="ADVERTISEMENT_TO_THE_FIRST_EDITION">ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.</a></h3>


<p>When this pamphlet was undertaken, the
Author had no thought of swelling it to it's present
bulk; but communicating his design to his friends,
they favoured him with various particulars of information.
Some of these accommodated themselves
to his original plan, if he can be supposed to have
had any, but others were more intractable. Still
aware of the value even of disjointed materials, which
his profession would not afford him leisure to compact
into a regular narrative, and conscious that these
sheets, rude and imperfect as they are, may serve to
promote a publication less unworthy of its subject,
he dismisses his present work without any laboured
apology for the errors that may be detected in it;
claiming, indeed, some merit on account of intelligence,
but not the least on the score of arrangement
or composition. He takes the same opportunity to
observe, that many curious anecdotes of extraordinary
persons have been unfortunately lost, because
the possessors of those fugitive particulars had not
the power of communicating them in proper form,
or polished language, and were unwilling to expose
them in such a state as these are offered to the world.</p>

<p>having
translated the First Edition of these Anecdotes,

by the obliging letter here subjoined:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>SIR,</p>

<p>Though I have not the honour of being
acquainted with you, I hope your goodness will excuse
the liberty I take of sending you a <i>German</i>
translation of the <i>Biographical Anecdotes of Mr. Hogarth</i>
you published. Being convinced of the merits
of your production, and its usefulness to such collectors
of prints and connoisseurs in our country as
don't understand the <i>English</i> language, I undertook
this translation, and flatter myself you will be
pleased to accept of it as a proof of my real esteem
for you.</p>

<p>You will find, that I did not always adhere literally
to the original, but made some abridgments,
alterations, notes, &amp;c. &amp;c. But I hope you will do
me the justice to consider, that I wrote for my countrymen,
and therefore left out such passages, poems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
anecdotes, &amp;c. &amp;c. as would have been entirely uninteresting
to them, and have swelled the volume to
no purpose.</p>

<p>As to the typographical performance, I think you
will be tolerably satisfied of it. Though the noble
art of printing is of <i>German</i> origin, your nation has
improved and brought it to the highest pitch of
perfection in point of neatness, elegance, and correctness.</p>

<p>I remain, with all possible esteem,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</span></p>

<p>Your most obedient</p>

<p>Pardon my presumption in offering you the
slender fruit of a few leisure hours. Receive it with
your wonted kindness, and judge of it not by the
trifling value of the work, but by the intention of its
Author, whose most zealous wish has long been to
find an opportunity of publickly offering you, however
small, a memorial of his respect and friendship.</p>

<p>If my labour in adding a mite towards the diffusion
of the knowledge of the Arts, is honoured with
the approbation of so enlightened a Connoisseur, I
shall feel myself completely rewarded.</p>

<p>Receive at the same time my sincerest thanks for
the obliging communication of your Copy of <i>Hogarth's</i>

more than once availed myself.</p>

<p>Live, honoured Sir, many days; happy in the
bosom of your worthy family, in the circle of your
friends, and in the enjoyment of those treasures of
the Arts you have collected with such distinguished
taste. Remain also a friend of</p>

<h4>PREFACE.</h4>

<h5>To the <span class="smcap">German Reader</span>.</h5>

<p>Collectors of the Fine Arts were already
possessed of <i>Catalogues</i> and <i>Memoires Raisonnées</i> of the
engravings of many great masters, for which their
acknowledgements are due to the industry of a
<i>Gersaint</i>, a <i>Jombert</i>, a <i>Hecquet</i>, a <i>Vertue</i>, a <i>de Winter</i>,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>But a similar illustration of <span class="smcap">Hogarth's</span> copper-plates
was still wanting; though it may be asked
what works have a juster claim to a distinguished
place in a compleat collection, than those of this
instructive moral painter, this creative genius?</p>

<p>On this account, it is presumed that the <i>German</i>
Lover of the Arts will deem himself indebted to
the Translator, for giving him, in his own tongue,
a concise and faithful version of a book that has
lately made its appearance in <i>London</i>, under the
title of "Biographical Anecdotes of <i>W. Hogarth</i>,
and a Catalogue of his Works chronologically arranged."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>The Compiler as well as Editor of this work is
Mr. <span class="smcap">John Nichols</span>, a <i>Printer</i> and <i>Bookseller</i> in
<i>London</i>, who, by much reading, and an intimate acquaintance
with the Arts and Literature of his
Country, has honourably distinguished himself among
his professional brethren. How modestly he
himself judges of this his useful performance, appears
from his preface to the work.</p>

<p>It is true, Mr. <span class="smcap">Horace Walpole</span>, who possesses
perhaps the compleatest collection of the prints of
this Master, some years ago published a Catalogue
of them; but this is only to be found in his work,
intituled, "<i>Anecdotes of Painting in England collected
by G. Vertue, and published by H. Walpole</i>," a performance
consisting of four volumes in 4to, too
costly for many collectors, and inconvenient for
others. Moreover all that is to be found there relative
to <i>Hogarth</i>, is not only included in Mr.
<i>Nichols's</i> publication, but is also improved by considerable
additions, so that the curious reader has <i>Walpole's</i>
Catalogue incorporated with the present work.</p>

<p>The liberty of abridgement, as mentioned in the
title, is ventured only in regard to such diffuse illustrations,
repetitions, anecdotes, and local stories, as
would be alone interesting to an <i>Englishman</i>; in a word,
in such parts as do not immediately contribute to
the illustration of <i>Hogarth's</i> plates, and would have
tired the patience of the <i>German</i> reader. Of the verses
affixed to each copper-plate the first and last words
only are given, as those afford sufficient indication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
for a collector who wishes to become acquainted
with any particular print. How far some remarks
of the Translator are useful, or otherwise, is left to
the indulgent decision of Judges in the Arts.</p>

<p>He must not however forget it is his duty to acknowledge
the goodness of old Mr. <span class="smcap">Hansen</span> of
<i>Leipsig</i>. This gentleman's readiness in permitting
him to examine his excellent collection of the engravings
of <i>British</i> artists, for the purpose of comparing
and illustrating several passages in the original
of this work, claims his warmest thanks, and a
public acknowledgement.</p>

<h3>"HOGARTH'S ORIGINAL WORKS.</h3>

<p>"As an opinion generally prevails, that the genuine
impressions of <i>Hogarth's</i> works are very bad, and the
plates retouched; Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i> is under the necessity
of acquainting the public in general, and the admirers
of her deceased husband's works in particular,
that it has been owing to a want of proper attention
in the conducting this work for some years past, that
the impressions in general have not done justice to
the condition of the plates; and she has requested
some gentlemen most eminent in the art of engraving,
to inspect the plates, who have given the following
opinion:</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 10em;">"<i>London, Jan.</i> 21, 1783.</span></p>

<p>"We, whose names are underwritten, having carefully
examined the copper-plates published by the
late Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, are fully convinced that they have
not been retouched since his death.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"FRANCIS BARTOLOZZI.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">WM. WOOLLET.<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">WM. WYNNE RYLAND.<a name="FNanchor_2_9" id="FNanchor_2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_9" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>"N. B. All<a name="FNanchor_3_10" id="FNanchor_3_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_10" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the original works are now properly
and well printed, and to be had of Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>, at
her house at <i>The Golden Head</i>, in <i>Leicester-Fields</i>."</p>

<p>This is one of the most extraordinary testimonials
ever laid before the public. <i>Hogarth</i> died in 1764.
Since that time his plates have been injudiciously
and unmercifully worked, so as to leave no means
of ascertaining, through any observation or process
of art, the exact period when they were last repaired.
Notwithstanding this difficulty, in the year
1783, we find several engravers of eminence declaring
their full conviction on the subject. All we can
do is, to suppose their confidence was grounded on
the veracity of Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>. I believe the parties
as to the fact; and yet it was impossible for Messieurs
<i>B. W.</i> and <i>R.</i> to be adequate judges of the truth to
which they have set their names as witnesses.</p>

<h2><a name="HOGARTH" id="HOGARTH">HOGARTH.</a></h2>

<p>This great and original Genius is said by Dr.
<i>Burn</i> to have been the descendant of a family
originally from <i>Kirkby Thore</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in <i>Westmoreland</i>: and I
am assured that his grandfather was a plain yeoman,
who possessed a small tenement in the vale of <i>Bampton</i>,
a village about 15 miles North of <i>Kendal</i>, in
that county. He had three sons. The eldest assisted
his father in farming, and succeeded to his little freehold.
The second settled in <i>Troutbeck</i>, a village
eight miles North West of <i>Kendal</i>, and was remarkable
for his talent at provincial poetry.<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
third, educated at <i>St. Bee's</i>, who had kept a school
in the same county, and appears to have a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
some learning, went early to <i>London</i>, where he resumed
his original occupation of a school-master in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<i>Ship Court</i> in <i>The Old Bailey</i>, and was occasionally
employed as a corrector of the press. A <i>Latin</i> letter,
from Mr. <i>Richard Hogarth</i>, in 1697 (preserved
among the MSS. in <i>The British Museum</i>, N° 4277.
50.) relates to a book which had been printed
with great expedition. But the letter shall speak for
itself.<a name="FNanchor_3_14" id="FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_14" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
</p>

<p>A Dictionary in <i>Latin</i> and <i>English</i>, which he
composed for the use of schools,<a name="FNanchor_4_15" id="FNanchor_4_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_15" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> still exists in MS.
He married in <i>London</i>; and our Hero, and his sisters
<i>Mary</i> and <i>Anne</i>, are believed to have been the only
product of the marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Hogarth</span><a name="FNanchor_5_16" id="FNanchor_5_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_16" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> it said (under the article
<span class="smcap">Thornhill</span> in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>) to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
been born in 1698, in the parish of <i>St. Bartholomew,<a name="FNanchor_6_17" id="FNanchor_6_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_17" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
London</i>, to which parish, it is added, he
was afterwards a benefactor. The outset of his life,
however, was unpromising. "He was bound," says
Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, "to a mean engraver of arms on plate."
<i>Hogarth</i> probably chose this occupation, as it required
some skill in drawing, to which his genius
was particularly turned, and which he contrived
assiduously to cultivate. His master, it since appears,
was Mr. <i>Ellis Gamble</i>, a silversmith of eminence,
who resided in <i>Cranbourn-street, Leicester-fields</i>.
In this profession it is not unusual to bind apprentices
to the single branch of engraving arms and
cyphers on every species of metal; and in that particular
department of the business young <i>Hogarth</i>
was placed;<a name="FNanchor_7_19" id="FNanchor_7_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_19" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> "but, before his time was expired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
he felt the impulse of genius, and that it directed
him to painting."</p>

<p>During his apprenticeship, he set out one <i>Sunday</i>,
with two or three companions, on an excursion to
<i>Highgate</i>. The weather being hot, they went into
a public-house, where they had not been long, before
a quarrel arose between some persons in the
same room. One of the disputants struck the other
on the head with a quart pot, and cut him very
much. The blood running down the man's face,
together with the agony of the wound, which had
distorted his features into a most hideous grin, presented
<i>Hogarth</i>, who shewed himself thus early
"apprised of the mode Nature had intended he
should pursue," with too laughable a subject to
be overlooked. He drew out his pencil, and produced
on the spot one of the most ludicrous figures
that ever was seen. What rendered this piece the
more valuable was, that it exhibited an exact likeness
of the man, with the portrait of his antagonist,
and the figures in caricature of the principal persons
gathered round him. This anecdote was furnished
by one of his fellow apprentices then present, a
person of indisputable character, and who continued
his intimacy with <i>Hogarth</i> long after they both grew
up into manhood.</p>

<p>"His apprenticeship was no sooner expired," says
Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, "than he entered into the academy in
<i>St. Martin's Lane</i>, and studied drawing from the
life, in which he never attained to great excellence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
It was character, the passions, the soul,
that his genius was given him to copy. In colouring
he proved no greater a master: his force
lay in expression, not in tints and chiaro scuro."</p>

<p>To a man who by indefatigable industry and uncommon
strength of genius has been the artificer of
his own fame and fortune, it can be no reproach to
have it said that at one period he was not rich. It
has been asserted, and we believe with good foundation,
that the skill and assiduity of <i>Hogarth</i> were,
even in his servitude, a singular assistance to his own
family, and to that of his master. It happened,
however, that when he was first out of his time, he
certainly was poor. The ambition of indigence is
ever productive of distress. So it fared with <i>Hogarth</i>,
who, while he was furnishing himself with
materials for subsequent perfection, felt all the contempt
which penury could produce. Being one day
distressed to raise so trifling a sum as twenty shillings,
in order to be revenged of his landlady, who strove
to compel him to payment, he drew her as ugly as
possible, and in that single portrait gave marks of
the dawn of superior genius.<a name="FNanchor_8_20" id="FNanchor_8_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_20" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This story I had
once supposed to be founded on certainty; but since,
on other authority, have been assured, that had such
an accident ever happened to him, he would not
have failed to talk of it afterwards, as he was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
fond of contrasting the necessities of his youth with
the affluence of his maturer age. He has been heard
to say of himself, "I remember the time when I
have gone moping into the city with scarce a shilling
in my pocket; but as soon as I had received
ten guineas there for a plate, I have returned
home, put on my sword, and sallied out again,
with all the confidence of a man who had ten
thousand pounds in his pocket." Let me add,
that my first authority may be to the full as good
as my second.</p>

<p>How long he continued in obscurity we cannot
exactly learn; but the first piece in which he distinguished
himself as a painter, is supposed to have been
a representation of <i>Wanstead Assembly</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9_21" id="FNanchor_9_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_21" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In this are
introduced portraits of the first earl <i>Tylney</i>, his lady,
their children, tenants, &amp;c. The faces were said
to be extremely like, and the colouring is rather better
than in some of his late and more highly finished
performances.</p>

<p>From the date of the earliest plate that can be ascertained
to be the work of <i>Hogarth</i>, it may be presumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that he began business, on his own account,
at least as early as the year 1720.</p>

<p>His first employment seems to have been the engraving
of arms and shop-bills. The next step was
to design and furnish plates for booksellers; and
here we are fortunately supplied with dates.<a name="FNanchor_10_22" id="FNanchor_10_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_22" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Thirteen
folio prints, with his name to each, appeared
in "<i>Aubry de la Motraye's</i> Travels," in 1723;
seven smaller prints for "<i>Apuleius'</i> Golden Ass"
in 1724; fifteen head-pieces to "<i>Beaver's</i> Military
Punishments of the Ancients," and five frontispieces
for the translation of <i>Cassandra</i>, in five volumes,
12°, 1725; seventeen cuts for a duodecimo edition
of <i>Hudibras</i> (with <i>Butler's</i> head) in 1726; two for
"<i>Perseus</i> and <i>Andromeda</i>," in 1730; two for <i>Milton</i>
[the date uncertain]; and a variety of others between
1726 and 1733.</p>

<p>"No symptom of genius," says Mr. <i>Walpole</i>,
"dawned in those plates. His <i>Hudibras</i> was the first
of his works that marked him as a man above the
common; yet, what made him then noticed, now
surprises us, to find so little humour in an undertaking
so congenial to his talents."&mdash;It is certain
that he often lamented to his friends the having parted
with his property in the prints of the large <i>Hudibras</i>,
without ever having had an opportunity to improve
them. They were purchased by Mr. <i>Philip Overton</i>,<a name="FNanchor_11_23" id="FNanchor_11_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_23" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
at the <i>Golden Buck</i>, near <i>St. Dunstan's Church</i> in <i>Fleet-Street</i>;
and still remain in the possession of his successor
Mr. <i>Sayer</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Bowles</i> at the <i>Black Horse</i> in <i>Cornhill</i> was one
of his earliest patrons. I had been told that he
bought many a plate from <i>Hogarth</i> by the weight of
the copper; but am only certain that this occurrence
happened in a single instance, when the elder Mr.
<i>Bowles</i> of <i>St. Paul's Church-yard</i> offered, over a
bottle, half a crown a pound for a plate just then
completed. This circumstance was within the knowledge
of Dr. <i>Ducarel</i>.&mdash;Our artist's next friend in that
line was Mr. <i>Philip Overton</i>, who paid him a somewhat
better price for his labour and ingenuity.</p>

<p>When Mr. <i>Walpole</i> speaks of <i>Hogarth's</i> early performances,
he observes, that they rose not above the
labours of the people who are generally employed
by booksellers. Lest any reader should inadvertently
suppose this candid writer designed the minutest reflection
on those artists to whom the decoration of
modern volumes is confided, it is necessary to observe,
that his account of <i>Hogarth</i>, &amp;c. was printed
off above ten years ago, before the names of <i>Cipriani,
Angelica, Bartolozzi, Sherwin,</i> and <i>Mortimer</i> were
found at the bottom of any plates designed for the
ornament of poems, or dramatic pieces.</p>

<p>"On the success, however, of those plates," Mr.
<i>Walpole</i> says, "he commenced painter, a painter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
portraits; the most ill-suited employment imaginable
to a man whose turn certainly was not flattery,
nor his talent adapted to look on vanity
without a sneer. Yet his facility in catching a
likeness, and the method he chose of painting families
and conversations in small, then a novelty,
drew him prodigious business for some time. It
did not last, either from his applying to the real
bent of his disposition, or from his customers apprehending
that a satirist was too formidable a
confessor for the devotees of self-love." There
are still many family pictures by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> existing,
in the style of serious conversation-pieces. He
was not however lucky in all his resemblances, and
has sometimes failed where a crowd of other artists
have succeeded. The whole-length of Mr. <i>Garrick</i>
sitting at a table, with his wife behind him taking
the pen out of his hand,<a name="FNanchor_12_24" id="FNanchor_12_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_24" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> confers no honour on the
painter or the persons represented.<a name="FNanchor_13_25" id="FNanchor_13_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_25" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He has certainly
missed the character of our late <i>Roscius's</i> countenance
while undisturbed by passion; but was more
lucky in seizing his features when aggravated by
terror, as in the tent scene of King <i>Richard</i> III. It
is by no means astonishing, that the elegant symmetry
of Mrs. <i>Garrick's</i> form should have evaded the efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of one to whose ideas <i>la basse nature</i> was more familiar
than the grace inseparable from those who have
been educated in higher life. His talents, therefore,
could do little justice to a pupil of Lady <i>Burlington</i>.</p>

<p>What the prices of his portraits were, I have
strove in vain to discover; but suspect they were originally
very low, as the people who are best acquainted
with them chuse to be silent on that subject.</p>

<p>In the Bee, vol. V. p. 552. and also in the Gentleman's
Magazine, vol. IV. p. 269. are the following
verses to Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, on Miss <i>F.'s</i> picture, 1734.</p>

<blockquote><p>"To <i>Chloe's</i> picture you such likeness give,<br />
The animated canvas seems to live;<br />
The tender breasts with wanton heavings move,<br />
And the soft sparkling eyes inspire with love:<br />
While I survey each feature o'er and o'er,<br />
I turn <i>Idolater</i>, and paint adore:<br />
Fondly I here can gaze without a fear,<br />
That, <i>Chloe</i>, to my love you'd grow severe;<br />
That in your <i>Picture</i>, as in <i>Life</i>, you'd turn<br />
Your eyes away, and kill me with your scorn:<br />
No, here at least with transport I can see<br />
Your eyes with softness languishing on me.<br />
While, <i>Chloe</i>, this I boast, with scornful heart<br />
Nor rashly censure <i>Hogarth</i>, or his <i>art</i>,<br />
Who all your <i>Charms</i> in strongest <i>Light</i> has laid,<br />
And kindly thrown your <i>Pride</i> and <i>Scorn</i> in <i>Shade</i>."<br /></p></blockquote>

<p>At <i>Rivenhall</i>, in <i>Essex</i>, the seat of Mr. <i>Western</i>,
is a family picture, by <i>Hogarth</i> of Mr. <i>Western</i>
and his mother (who was a daughter of Sir <i>Anthony</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<i>Shirley</i>), Chancellor <i>Hoadly</i>, Archdeacon <i>Charles
Plumptre</i>, the Rev. Mr. <i>Cole</i> of <i>Milton</i> near <i>Cambridge</i>,
and Mr. <i>Henry Taylor</i> the Curate there,<a name="FNanchor_14_26" id="FNanchor_14_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_26" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> 1736.</p>

<p>In the gallery of the late Mr. <i>Cole</i> of <i>Milton</i>, was
also a small whole-length picture of Mr. <i>Western</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_27" id="FNanchor_15_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_27" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> by
<i>Hogarth</i>, a striking resemblance. He is drawn sitting
in his Fellow-Commoner's habit, and square cap
with a gold tassel, in his chamber at <i>Clare Hall</i>,
over the arch towards the river; and our artist, as the
chimney could not be expressed, has drawn a cat
sitting near it, agreeable to his humour, to shew the
situation.</p>

<p>"When I sat to him," says Mr. <i>Cole</i>, "near fifty
years ago, the custom of giving vails to servants
was not discontinued. On my taking leave of our
painter at the door, and his servant's opening it
or the coach door, I cannot tell which, I offered
him a small gratuity; but the man very politely
refused it, telling me it would be as much as the
loss of his place, if his master knew it. This was
so uncommon, and so liberal in a man of Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i>
profession at that time of day, that it much
struck me, as nothing of the sort had happened
to me before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>It was likewise Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> custom to sketch out
on the spot any remarkable face which particularly
struck him, and of which he wished to preserve the
remembrance. A gentleman still living informs me,
that being once with our painter at the <i>Bedford
Coffee-house</i>, he observed him to draw something
with a pencil on his nail. Enquiring what had been
his employment, he was shewn the countenance (a
whimsical one) of a person who was then at a small
distance.</p>

<p>It happened in the early part of <i>Hogarth's</i> life,
that a nobleman, who was uncommonly ugly and
deformed, came to sit to him for his picture. It was
executed with a skill that did honour to the artist's
abilities; but the likeness was rigidly observed, without
even the necessary attention to compliment or
flattery. The peer, disgusted at this counterpart of
his dear self, never once thought of paying for a reflector
that would only insult him with his deformities.
Some time was suffered to elapse before the artist applied
for his money; but afterwards many applications
were made by him (who had then no need of a
banker) for payment, without success. The painter,
however, at last hit upon an expedient, which he
knew must alarm the nobleman's pride, and by that
means answer his purpose. It was couched in the
following card:</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> dutiful respects to Lord &mdash;&mdash;;
finding that he does not mean to have the picture
which was drawn for him, is informed again of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Mr. <i>H.'s</i> necessity for the money; if, therefore,
his lordship does not send for it in three days, it
will be disposed of, with the addition of a tail,
and some other little appendages, to Mr. <i>Hare</i>,
the famous wild-beast man; Mr. <i>H.</i> having given
that gentleman a conditional promise of it for an
exhibition-picture, on his lordship's refusal."</p>

<p>This intimation had the desired effect. The picture
was sent home, and committed to the flames.</p>

<p>To the other anecdotes of this comic Painter may
be added the following. Its authenticity must apologize
for its want of other merit.</p>

<p>A certain old Nobleman, not remarkably generous,
having sent for <i>Hogarth</i>, desired he would represent,
in one of the compartments on a staircase,
<i>Pharaoh</i> and his Host drowned in the <i>Red Sea</i>; but
at the same time gave our artist to understand, that
no great price would be given for his performance.
<i>Hogarth</i> agreed. Soon after, he waited on his employer
for payment, who seeing that the space allotted
for the picture had only been daubed over
with red, declared he had no idea of paying a painter
when he had proceeded no further than to lay
his <i>ground</i>. "<i>Ground!</i>" said <i>Hogarth</i>, "there is no
<i>ground</i> in the case, my lord. The red you perceive,
is the <i>Red Sea. Pharaoh</i> and his Host are drowned
as you desired, and cannot be made objects of sight,
for the ocean covers them all."</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole</i> has remarked, that if our artist "indulged
his spirit of ridicule in personalities, it
never proceeded beyond sketches and drawings,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and wonders "that he never, without intention, delivered
the very features of any identical person."
But this elegant writer, who may be said to have received
his education in a Court, perhaps had few
opportunities of acquaintance among the low popular
characters with which <i>Hogarth</i> occasionally peopled
his scenes.<a name="FNanchor_16_28" id="FNanchor_16_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_28" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The Friend to whom I owe this remark
was assured by an ancient gentleman of unquestionable
veracity and acuteness of observation, that almost
all the personages who attend the levee of the
Rake were undoubted portraits; and that, in <i>Southwark
Fair</i> and the <i>Modern Midnight Conversation</i>, as
many more were discoverable. In the former plate
he pointed out <i>Essex</i> the dancing-master; and in the
latter, as well as in the second plate to the <i>Rake's
Progress, Figg</i> the prize-fighter.<a name="FNanchor_17_29" id="FNanchor_17_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_29" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He mentioned
several others by name, from his immediate knowledge
both of the painter's design and the characters
represented; but the rest of the particulars, by which
he supported his assertions, have escaped the memory
of my informant. I am also assured, that while <i>Hogarth</i>
was painting the <i>Rake's Progress</i>, he had a
summer residence at <i>Isleworth</i>; and never failed to
question the company who came to see these pictures,
if they knew for whom one or another figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
was designed. When they guessed wrong, he set
them right.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole</i> has a sketch in oil, given to him by
<i>Hogarth</i>, who intended to engrave it. It was done
at the time when the House of Commons appointed
a committee to inquire into the cruelties exercised on
prisoners in the <i>The Fleet</i>, to extort money from them.
"The scene," he says, "is the committee; on the
table are the instruments of torture. A prisoner
in rags, half-starved, appears before them; the
poor man has a good countenance, that adds to
the interest. On the other hand is the inhuman
gaoler. It is the very figure that <i>Salvator Rosa</i>
would have drawn for <i>Iago</i> in the moment of detection.
Villainy, fear, and conscience, are mixed
in yellow and livid on his countenance; his lips
are contracted by tremor, his face advances as
eager to lie, his legs step back as thinking to
make his escape; one hand is thrust precipitately
into his bosom, the fingers of the other are catching
uncertainly at his button-holes. If this was a
portrait, it is the most striking that ever was
drawn; if it was not, it is still finer." The portrait
was that of <i>Bambridge</i><a name="FNanchor_18_30" id="FNanchor_18_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_30" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the warden of <i>The</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<i>Fleet</i>; and the sketch was taken in the beginning of
the year 1729, when <i>Bambridge</i> and <i>Huggins</i> (his
predecessor)<a name="FNanchor_19_31" id="FNanchor_19_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_31" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> were under examination. Both were
declared "notoriously guilty of great breaches of
trust, extortions, cruelties, and other high crimes
and misdemeanors;" both were sent to <i>Newgate</i>;
and <i>Bambridge</i> was disqualified by act of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_20_32" id="FNanchor_20_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_32" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The son<a name="FNanchor_21_33" id="FNanchor_21_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_33" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of <i>Huggins</i> was possessed of a valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
painting from this sketch, and also of a scene in the
<i>Beggar's Opera</i>; both of them full of real portraits.
On the dispersion of his effects, the latter was purchased
by the Rev. Dr. <i>Monkhouse</i> of <i>Queen's College,
Oxford</i>. It is in a gilt frame, with a bust of <i>Gay</i> at
the top. It's companion, whose present possessor I
have not been able to trace out, had, in like manner,
that of Sir <i>Francis Page</i>, one of the judges, remarkable
for his severity;<a name="FNanchor_22_34" id="FNanchor_22_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_34" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> with a halter round his
neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>The Duke of <i>Leeds</i> has also an original scene in
the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>, painted by <i>Hogarth</i>. It is that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
which <i>Lucy</i> and <i>Polly</i> are on their knees, before
their respective fathers, to intercede for the life
of the hero of the piece. All the figures are either
known or supposed to be portraits. If I am not misinformed,
the late Sir <i>Thomas Robinson</i> (as well
known by the name of <i>Long Sir Thomas</i>) is standing
in one of the side-boxes. <i>Macheath</i>, unlike his
spruce representative on our present stage, is a
slouching bully; and <i>Polly</i> appears happily disencumbered
of such a hoop as the daughter of <i>Peachum</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
within our younger memories has worn. His Grace
gave 35 <i>l.</i> for this picture at Mr. <i>Rich's</i> auction. Another
copy of the same scene was bought by the
late Sir <i>William Saunderson</i>; and is now in the possession
of Sir <i>Henry Gough</i>. Mr. <i>Walpole</i> has a painting
of a scene in the same piece, where <i>Macheath</i>
is going to execution. In this also the likenesses of
<i>Walker</i>, and Miss <i>Fenton</i> afterwards Dutchess of <i>Bolton</i>
(the original <i>Macheath</i> and <i>Polly</i>), are preserved.</p>

<p>In the year 1726, when the affair of <i>Mary Tofts</i>,
the rabbit-breeder of <i>Godalming</i>, engaged the public
attention, a few of our principal surgeons subscribed
their guinea a-piece to <i>Hogarth</i>, for an engraving
from a ludicrous sketch he had made on that very
popular subject. This plate, amongst other portraits,
contains that of the notorious <i>St. André</i>, the anatomist
to the royal household, and in high credit as a
surgeon. The additional celebrity of this man arose
either from fraud or ignorance, perhaps from a due
mixture of both. It was supported, however, afterwards,
by the reputation of a dreadful crime. His
imaginary wealth, in spite of these disadvantages, to
the last insured him a circle of flatterers, even
though, at the age of fourscore, his conversation
was offensive to modest ears, and his grey hairs were
rendered still more irreverend by repeated acts of
untimely lewdness.<a name="FNanchor_23_39" id="FNanchor_23_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_39" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> A particular description of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
this plate will be given in the future catalogue of
<i>Hogarth's</i> works.</p>

<p>In 1727, <i>Hogarth</i> agreed with <i>Morris</i>, an upholsterer,
to furnish him with a design on canvas, representing
the element of Earth, as a pattern for tapestry.
The work not being performed to the satisfaction of
<i>Morris</i>, he refused to pay for it; and our artist sued
him for the money. This suit (which was tried before
Lord Chief Justice <i>Eyre</i> at <i>Westminster, May</i> 28,
1728) was determined in favour of <i>Hogarth</i>. The
brief for the defendant in the cause, is preserved
below.<a name="FNanchor_24_40" id="FNanchor_24_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_40" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1730, Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> married the only daughter
of Sir <i>James Thornhill</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_41" id="FNanchor_25_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_41" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> by whom he had no child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
This union, indeed, was a stolen one, and consequently
without the approbation of Sir <i>James</i>, who,
considering the youth of his daughter, then barely
eighteen, and the slender finances of her husband,
as yet an obscure artist,<a name="FNanchor_26_42" id="FNanchor_26_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_42" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> was not easily reconciled to
the match. Soon after this period, however, he began
his <i>Harlot's Progress</i> (the coffin in the last plate
is inscribed <i>September</i> 2, 1731); and was advised by
Lady <i>Thornhill</i> to have some of the scenes in it placed
in the way of his father-in-law. Accordingly, one
morning early, Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i> undertook to convey
several of them into his dining-room. When he
arose, he enquired from whence they came; and
being told by whom they were introduced, he cried
out, "Very well; the man who can furnish representations
like these, can also maintain a wife
without a portion." He designed this remark as
an excuse for keeping his purse-strings close; but,
soon after, became both reconciled and generous to
the young couple.</p>

<p>Our artist's reputation was so far established in
1731, that it drew forth a poetical compliment from
Mr. <i>Mitchell</i>, in the epistle already quoted.</p>

<p>An allegorical cieling by Sir <i>James Thornhill</i> is at
the house of the late Mr. <i>Huggins</i>, at <i>Headley Park,
Hants</i>. The subject of it is the story of <i>Zephyrus</i>
and <i>Flora</i>; and the figure of a Satyr and some others
were painted by <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1732 (the year in which he was one of the
party who made <i>A Tour by land and Water</i>, which
will be duly noticed in the <a href="#Page_413">Catalogue</a>) he ventured
to attack Mr. <i>Pope</i>, in a plate called "The Man
of Taste;" containing a view of the Gate of <i>Burlington-house</i>;
with <i>Pope</i> whitewashing it, and bespattering
the Duke of <i>Chandos's</i> coach.<a name="FNanchor_27_43" id="FNanchor_27_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_43" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This plate
was intended as a satire on the translator of <i>Homer</i>,
Mr. <i>Kent</i> the architect, and the Earl of <i>Burlington</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
It was fortunate for <i>Hogarth</i> that he escaped the lash
of the former. Either <i>Hogarth's</i> obscurity at that
time was his protection, or the bard was too prudent
to exasperate a painter who had already given such
proof of his abilities for satire. What must <i>he</i> have
felt who could complain of the "pictured shape"
prefixed to <i>Gulliveriana, Pope Alexander's Supremacy
and Infallibility examined,</i> &amp;c. by <i>Ducket</i>, and other
pieces, had our artist undertaken to express in colours
a certain transaction recorded by <i>Cibber</i>?</p>

<p>Soon after his marriage, <i>Hogarth</i> had summer-lodgings
at <i>South-Lambeth</i>; and being intimate with
Mr. <i>Tyers</i>, contributed to the improvement of <i>The
Spring Gardens</i> at <i>Vauxhall</i>, by the hint of embellishing
them with paintings, some of which were the
suggestions of his own truly comic pencil. Among
these were the "Four parts of the Day," copied
by <i>Hayman</i> from the designs of our artist. The
scenes of "Evening" and "Night" are still there;
and portraits of <i>Henry</i> VIII. and <i>Anne Bullen</i> once
adorned the old great room on the right hand of the
entry into the gardens. For his assistance, Mr. <i>Tyers</i>
gratefully presented him with a gold ticket of admission
for himself and his friends, inscribed</p>

<blockquote><p>
in perpetuam beneficii memoriam.</p></blockquote>

<p>This ticket, now in the possession of his widow, is
still occasionally made use of.</p>

<p>In 1733 his genius became conspicuously known.
The third scene of his "Harlot's Progress" introduced
him to the notice of the great. At a board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of Treasury which was held a day or two after the
appearance of that print, a copy of it was shewn by
one of the lords, as containing, among other excellencies,
a striking likeness of Sir <i>John Gonson</i>.<a name="FNanchor_28_44" id="FNanchor_28_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_44" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
gave universal satisfaction; from the Treasury each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
lord repaired to the print-shop for a copy of it, and
<i>Hogarth</i> rose completely into fame. This anecdote
was related to Mr. <i>Huggins</i> by <i>Christopher Tilson</i>, esq.
one of the four chief clerks in the Treasury, and at
that period under-secretary of state. He died <i>August</i>
25, 1742, after having enjoyed the former of these
offices fifty-eight years. I should add, however,
that Sir <i>John Gonson</i> is not here introduced to be
made ridiculous, but is only to be considered as the
image of an active magistrate identified.</p>

<p>The familiarity of the subject, and the propriety
of it's execution, made the "Harlot's Progress"
tasted by all ranks of people. Above twelve hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
names were entered in our artist's subscription-book.
It was made into a pantomime by <i>Theophilus Cibber</i>;
and again represented on the stage, under the title
of <i>The Jew decoyed, or a Harlot's Progress</i>, in a
Ballad Opera. Fan-mounts were likewise engraved,
containing miniature representations of all the six
plates. These were usually printed off with red ink,
three compartments on one side, and three on the
other.<a name="FNanchor_29_47" id="FNanchor_29_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_47" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The ingenious Abbé <i>Du Bos</i> has often complained,
that no history-painter of his time went through a
series of actions, and thus, like an historian, painted
the successive fortune of an hero, from the cradle to
the grave. What <i>Du Bos</i> wished to see done, <i>Hogarth</i>
performed. He launches out his young adventurer
a simple girl upon the town, and conducts
her through all the vicissitudes of wretchedness to a
premature death. This was painting to the understanding
and to the heart; none had ever before
made the pencil subservient to the purposes of morality
and instruction; a book like this is fitted to
every soil and every observer, and he that runs may
read. Nor was the success of <i>Hogarth</i> confined to
his persons. One of his excellencies consisted in
what may be termed the furniture<a name="FNanchor_30_48" id="FNanchor_30_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_48" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of his pieces; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
as in sublime and historical representations the fewer
trivial circumstances are permitted to divide the spectator's
attention from the principal figures, the greater
is their force; so in scenes copied from familiar life,
a proper variety of little domestic images contributes
to throw a degree of verisimilitude on the whole.
"The Rake's levee-room," says Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, "the
nobleman's dining-room, the apartments of the
husband and wife in Marriage Alamode, the Alderman's
parlour, the bed-chamber, and many
others, are the history of the manners of the age."</p>

<p>It may also be observed, that <i>Hogarth</i>, both in the
third and last plate of the <i>Harlot's Progress</i>, has appropriated
a name to his heroine which belonged to
a well-known wanton then upon the town. The
<i>Grub-street Journal</i> for <i>August</i> 6, 1730, giving an account
of several prostitutes who were taken up, informs
us that "the fourth was <i>Kate Hackabout</i>
(whose brother was lately hanged at <i>Tyburn</i>), a
woman noted in and about the hundreds of
<i>Drury, &amp;c.</i>"</p>

<p>In 1735 our artist lost his mother, as appears by
the following extract from an old Magazine: "<i>June</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
11, 1735. Died Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>, mother to the
celebrated painter, of a fright from the fire which
happened on the 9th, in <i>Cecil Court, St. Martin's
Lane</i>, and burnt thirteen houses;<a name="FNanchor_31_49" id="FNanchor_31_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_49" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> amongst others,
one belonging to <i>John Huggins</i>, esq. late Warden
of <i>The Fleet</i>, was greatly damaged."</p>

<p>The "Rake's Progress" (published in the same
year, and sold at <i>Hogarth's</i> house, the <i>Golden Head</i>
in <i>Leicester Fields</i>), though "perhaps superior, had
not," as Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes, "so much success,
from want of novelty; nor is the print of the
arrest equal in merit to the others.<a name="FNanchor_32_50" id="FNanchor_32_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_50" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>"The curtain, however," says he, "was now
drawn aside, and his genius stood displayed in its
full lustre. From time to time our artist continued
to give those works that would be immortal, if
the nature of his art will allow it. Even the receipts
for his subscriptions had wit in them. Many
of his plates he engraved himself, and often expunged
faces etched by his assistants, when they
had not done justice to his ideas. Not content
with shining in a path untrodden before, he was
ambitious of distinguishing himself as a painter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
history; and in 1736 presented to the hospital of
<i>St. Bartholomew</i>, of which he had been appointed
a governor,<a name="FNanchor_33_51" id="FNanchor_33_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_51" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> a painting of the <i>Pool of Bethesda</i>,
and another of the <i>Good Samaritan</i>. But the genius
that had entered so feelingly into the calamities
and crimes of familiar life, deserted him in a
walk that called for dignity and grace. The
burlesque turn of his mind mixed itself with the
most serious subjects. In the <i>Pool of Bethesda</i>, a
servant of a rich ulcerated lady beats back a poor
man that sought the same celestial remedy; and
in his <i>Danae</i> [for which the Duke of <i>Ancaster</i>
paid 60 guineas] the old nurse tries a coin of the
golden shower with her teeth, to see if it is true
gold. Both circumstances are justly thought, but
rather too ludicrous. It is a much more capital
fault that <i>Danae</i> herself is a mere nymph of
<i>Drury</i>. He seems to have conceived no higher
degree of beauty." Dr. <i>Parsons</i> also, in his Lectures
on Physiognomy, 410. p. 58, says, "Thus
yielded <i>Danae</i> to the Golden Shower, and thus
was her passion painted by the ingenious Mr.
<i>Hogarth</i>."</p>

<p>The novelty and excellence of <i>Hogarth's</i> performances
soon tempted the needy artist and print-dealer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to avail themselves of his designs,<a name="FNanchor_34_52" id="FNanchor_34_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_52" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and rob
him of the advantages which he was entitled to derive
from them. This was particularly the case with
the "Midnight Conversation," the "Harlot's" and
"Rake's" Progresses,<a name="FNanchor_35_53" id="FNanchor_35_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_53" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and the rest of his early
works. To put a stop to depredations like these on
the property of himself and others, and to secure
the emoluments resulting from his own labours, as
Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes, he applied to the legislature,
and obtained an act of parliament, 8 <i>George</i> II.
chap. 3°, to vest an exclusive right in designers and
engravers, and to restrain the multiplying of copies
of their works without the consent of the artist.<a name="FNanchor_36_54" id="FNanchor_36_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_54" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>This statute was drawn by his friend Mr. <i>Huggins</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37_55" id="FNanchor_37_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_55" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
who took for his model the eighth of Queen <i>Anne</i>,
in favour of literary property; but it was not so accurately
executed as entirely to remedy the evil; for,
in a cause founded on it, which came before Lord
<i>Hardwicke</i> in Chancery, that excellent Lawyer determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
that no assignee, claiming under an assignment
from the original inventor, could take any benefit
by it. <i>Hogarth</i>, immediately after the passing
the act, published a small print, with emblematical
devices, and the following inscription expressing his
gratitude to the three branches of the legislature:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
"In humble and grateful acknowledgment<br />
Of the grace and goodness of the LEGISLATURE,<br />
Manifested<br />
In the ACT of PARLIAMENT for the Encouragement<br />
Of the Arts of Designing, Engraving, &amp;c.<br />
Obtained<br />
By the Endeavours, and almost at the sole Expence,<br />
Of the Designer of this Print in the Year 1735;<br />
By which<br />
Not only the Professors of those Arts were rescued<br />
From the Tyranny, Frauds, and Piracies<br />
Of Monopolizing Dealers,<br />
And legally entitled to the Fruits of their own Labours;<br />
But Genius and Industry were also prompted<br />
By the most noble and generous Inducements to exert themselves;<br />
Emulation was excited,<br />
Ornamental Compositions were better understood;<br />
And every Manufacture, where Fancy has any concern,<br />
Was gradually raised to a Pitch of Perfection before unknown;<br />
Insomuch, that those of <span class="smcap">Great-Britain</span><br />
Are at present the most Elegant<br />
And the most in Esteem of any in <span class="smcap">Europe</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>This plate he afterwards made to serve for a receipt
for subscriptions, first to a print of an "Election
Entertainment;" and afterwards for three prints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
more, representing the "polling for members for
parliament, canvassing for votes, and chairing the
members." The royal crown at the top of this
receipt is darting its rays on mitres, coronets, the
Chancellor's great seal, the Speaker's hat, &amp;c. &amp;c.
and on a scroll is written, "An Act for the Encouragement
of the Arts of Designing, Engraving,
and Etching, by vesting the Properties thereof in
the Inventors and Engravers, during the Time
therein mentioned." It was "Designed, etched,
and published as the Act directs, by <i>W. Hogarth,
March</i> 20, 1754." After <i>Hogarth's</i> death, the
legislature, by Stat. 7 <i>Geo.</i> III. chap. 38. granted to
his widow a further exclusive term of twenty years
in the property of her husband's works.</p>

<p>In 1736 he had the honour of being distinguished
in a masterly poem of a congenial Humourist. The
Dean of <i>St. Patrick's</i>, in his "Description of the
Legion Club," after pourtraying many characters
with all the severity of the most pointed satire, exclaims,</p>

<blockquote><p>
"How I want thee, humorous <i>Hogarth!</i><br />
Thou, I hear, a pleasant rogue art!<br />
Were but you and I acquainted,<br />
Every monster should be painted:<br />
You should try your graving tools<br />
On this odious group of fools;<br />
Draw the beasts as I describe them;<br />
Form their features, while I gibe them;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>Draw them like, for I assure ye,<br />
You will need no <i>caricatura</i>.<br />
Draw them so, that we may trace<br />
All the soul in every face."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>An elegant compliment was soon after paid to <i>Hogarth</i>
by <i>Somervile</i>, the author of <i>The Chace</i>, who
dedicates his <i>Hobbinol</i> to him as to "the greatest
master in the burlesque way." Yet <i>Fielding</i>, in
the Preface to <i>Joseph Andrews</i>, says, "He who
should call the ingenious <i>Hogarth</i> a burlesque
painter, would, in my opinion, do him very little
honour, for sure it is much easier, much less the
subject of admiration, to paint a man with a nose,
or any other feature of a preposterous size, or to
expose him in some absurd or monstrous attitude,
than to express the affections of men on canvas.
It hath been thought a vast commendation of a
painter, to say his figures seem to breathe; but
surely it is a much greater and nobler applause,
that they appear to think."<a name="FNanchor_38_56" id="FNanchor_38_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_56" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><i>Vincent Bourne</i>, that classical ornament of <i>Westminster
School</i>, addressed the following copy of hendecasyllables</p>

<p>By printed proposals, dated <i>Jan</i>. 25, 1744-5, <i>Hogarth</i>
offered to the highest bidder "the six pictures
called <i>The Harlot's Progress</i>, the eight pictures
called <i>The Rake's Progress</i>, the four pictures representing
<i>Morning, Noon, Evening,</i> and <i>Night,</i>
and that of <i>A Company of Strolling Actresses dressing
in a Barn</i>; all of them his own original paintings,
from which no other copies than the prints have
ever been taken." The biddings were to remain
open from the first to the last day of <i>February</i>, on
these conditions: "1. That every bidder shall have
an entire leaf numbered in the book of sale, on
the top of which will be entered the name and
place of abode, the sum paid by him, the time
when, and for which picture.&mdash;That, on the
last day of sale, a clock (striking every five minutes)
shall be placed in the room; and when it
hath struck five minutes after twelve, the first
picture mentioned in the sale-book will be deemed
as sold; the second picture when the clock hath
struck the next five minutes after twelve; and
so on successively till the whole nineteen pictures
are sold. 3. That none advance less than gold
at each bidding. 4. No person to bid on the last
day, except those whose names were before entered
in the book.&mdash;As Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> room is but
small, he begs the favour that no persons, except
those whose names are entered in the book, will
come to view his paintings on the last day of sale."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the six pictures of <i>Marriage à-la-mode</i>
were announced as intended for sale as soon
as the plates then taking from them should
be completed. This set of Prints may be regarded
as the ground-work of a novel called "The Marriage
Act," by Dr. <i>Shebbeare</i>, and of "The Clandestine
Marriage." In the prologue to that excellent
comedy, Mr. <i>Garrick</i> thus handsomely expressed his
regard for the memory of his friend:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Poets and painters, who from nature draw<br />
Their best and richest stores, have made this law:<br />
That each should neighbourly assist his brother,<br />
And steal with decency from one another.<br />
To-night, your matchless <i>Hogarth</i> gives the thought,<br />
Which from his canvas to the stage is brought.<br />
And who so fit to warm the poet's mind,<br />
As he who pictur'd morals and mankind?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>But not the same their characters and scenes;<br />
Both labour for one end, by different means:<br />
Each, as it suits him, takes a separate road,<br />
Their one great object, <i>Marriage à la Mode!</i><br />
Where titles deign with cits to have and hold,<br />
And change rich blood for more substantial gold!<br />
And honour'd trade from interest turns aside,<br />
To hazard happiness for titled pride.<br />
The painter dead, yet still he charms the eye;<br />
While <i>England</i> lives, his fame can never die:<br />
But he, 'who struts his hour upon the stage,'<br />
Can scarce extend his fame for half an age;<br />
Nor pen nor pencil can the actor save,<br />
The art, and artist, share one common grave."<a name="FNanchor_39_57" id="FNanchor_39_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_57" class="fnanchor">[39]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> had projected a <i>Happy Marriage</i>, by way
of counterpart to his <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>. A design
for the first of his intended six plates he had sketched
out in colours; and the following is as accurate an
account of it as could be furnished by a gentleman
who, long ago enjoyed only a few minutes' sight of
so imperfect a curiosity.</p>

<p>The time supposed was immediately after the return
of the parties from church. The scene lay in
the hall of an antiquated country mansion. On one
side, the married couple were represented sitting.
Behind them was a group of their young friends of
both sexes, in the act of breaking bride-cake over
their heads. In front appeared the father of the
young lady, grasping a bumper, and drinking, with
a seeming roar of exultation, to the future happiness
of her and her husband. By his side was a table
covered with refreshments. Jollity rather than politeness
was the designation of his character. Under
the screen of the hall, several rustic musicians in
grotesque attitudes, together with servants, tenants,
&amp;c. were arranged. Through the arch by which
the room was entered, the eye was led along a passage
into the kitchen, which afforded a glimpse of
sacerdotal luxury. Before the dripping-pan stood a
well-fed divine, in his gown and cassock, with his
watch in his hand, giving directions to a cook, drest
all in white, who was employed in basting a haunch
of venison.</p>

<p>Among the faces of the principal figures, none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
but that of the young lady was completely finished.
<i>Hogarth</i> had been often reproached for his inability
to impart grace and dignity to his heroines. The
bride was therefore meant to vindicate his pencil
from so degrading an imputation. The effort, however,
was unsuccessful. The girl was certainly
pretty; but her features, if I may use the term,
were uneducated. She might have attracted notice
as a chambermaid, but would have failed to extort
applause as a woman of fashion. The parson, and
his culinary associate, were more laboured than any
other parts of the picture. It is natural for us to
dwell longest on that division of a subject which is
most congenial to our private feelings. The painter
sat down with a resolution to delineate beauty improved
by art; but seems, as usual, to have deviated
into meanness; or could not help neglecting his original
purpose, to luxuriate in such ideas as his situation
in early life had fitted him to express. He
found himself, in short, out of his element in the
parlour, and therefore hastened, in quest of ease and
amusement, to the kitchen fire. <i>Churchill</i>, with
more force than delicacy, once observed of him,
that he only painted the <i>backside</i> of nature. It must
be allowed, that such an artist, however excellent
in his walk, was better qualified to represent the low-born
parent, than the royal preserver of a foundling.</p>

<p>The sketch already described (which I believe is
in Mrs. <i>Garrick's</i> possession) was made after the appearance
of <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>, and many years before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the artist's death. Why he did not persevere in
his plan, during such an interval of time, we can
only guess. It is probable that his undertaking required
a longer succession of images relative to domestic
happiness, than had fallen within his notice,
or courted his participation. <i>Hogarth</i> had no children;
and though the nuptial union may be happy
without them, yet such happiness will have nothing
picturesque in it; and we may observe of this truly
natural and faithful painter, that he rarely ventured
to exhibit scenes with which he was not perfectly
well acquainted.</p>

<p>Let us, however, more completely obviate an
objection that may be raised against the propriety of
the foregoing criticism. Some reader may urge, that
perhaps, all circumstances considered, a wedding celebrated
at an old mansion-house did not require the
appearance of consummate beauty, refined by the
powers of education. The remark has seeming justice
on its side; but <i>Hogarth</i> had previously avowed
his intent to exhibit a perfect face, divested of vulgarity;
and succeeded so well, at least in his own
opinion, that he carried the canvas, of which we
are now speaking, in triumph to Mr. <i>Garrick</i>, whose
private strictures on it coincided with those of the
person who furnishes this additional confirmation of
our painter's notorious ignorance in what is styled&mdash;<span class="smcap">the
graceful</span>. From the account I have received
concerning a design for a previous compartment belonging
to the same story, there is little reason to lament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the loss of it. It contained no appeal either
to the fancy or to the heart. An artist, who, representing
the marriage ceremony in a chapel, renders
the clerk, who lays the hassocks, the principal
figure in it, may at least be taxed with want of
judgement.</p>

<p>Soon after the peace of <i>Aix la Chapelle</i>, he went
over to <i>France</i>, and was taken into custody at <i>Calais</i>,
while he was drawing the gate of that town, a circumstance
which he has recorded in his picture, intituled,
"O the Roast Beef of <i>Old England</i>!" published
<i>March</i> 26, 1749. He was actually carried
before the governor as a spy, and, after a very strict
examination, committed a prisoner to <i>Grandsire</i>, his
landlord, on his promising that <i>Hogarth</i> should not
go out of his house till it was to embark for <i>England</i>.
This account, I have good authority for saying, he
himself gave to his friend Mr. <i>Gostling</i> at <i>Canterbury</i>,
at whose house he lay the night after his arrival.</p>

<p>The same accident, however, has been more circumstantially
related by an eminent <i>English</i> engraver,
who was abroad when it happened. <i>Hayman</i>, and
<i>Cheere</i> the statuary, were of the same party.</p>

<p>While <i>Hogarth</i> was in <i>France</i>, wherever he went,
he was sure to be dissatisfied with all he saw. If an
elegant circumstance either in furniture, or the ornaments
of a room, was pointed out as deserving
approbation, his narrow and constant reply was,
"What then? but it is <i>French</i>! Their houses
are all gilt and b&mdash;t." In the streets he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
often clamourously rude. A tatter'd bag, or a pair
of silk stockings with holes in them, drew a torrent
of imprudent language from him. In vain
did my informant (who knew that many <i>Scotch</i> and
<i>Irish</i> were often within hearing of these reproaches,
and would rejoice at least in an opportunity of getting
our painter mobbed) advise him to be more
cautious in his public remarks. He laughed at all
such admonition, and treated the offerer of it as a
pusillanimous wretch, unworthy of a residence in a
free country, making him the butt of his ridicule
for several evenings afterwards. This unreasonable
pleasantry was at length completely extinguished by
what happened while he was drawing the Gate at
<i>Calais</i>; for though the innocence of his design was
rendered perfectly apparent on the testimony of other
sketches he had about him, which were by no means
such as could serve the purpose of an engineer, he
was told by the Commandant, that, had not the
peace been actually signed, he should have been
obliged to have hung him up immediately on the
ramparts. Two guards were then provided to convey
him on shipboard; nor did they quit him till he
was three miles from the shore. They then spun him
round like a top, on the deck; and told him he was
at liberty to proceed on his voyage without farther
attendance or molestation. With the slightest allusion
to the ludicrous particulars of this affair, poor
<i>Hogarth</i> was by no means pleased. The leading circumstance
in it his own pencil has recorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after this period he purchased a little house
at <i>Chiswick</i>; where he usually passed the greatest
part of the summer season, yet not without occasional
visits to his dwelling in <i>Leicester Fields</i>.</p>

<p>In 1753, he appeared to the world in the character
of art author, and published a quarto volume,
intituled, "The Analysis of Beauty, written with a
view of fixing the fluctuating Ideas of Taste."
In this performance he shews, by a variety of examples,
that a curve is the line of beauty, and that
round swelling figures are most pleasing to the eye;
and the truth of his opinion has been countenanced
by subsequent writers on the subject.</p>

<p>Among the letters of Dr. <i>Birch</i> is the following
short one, sent with the "Analysis of Beauty," and
dated <i>Nov.</i> 25, 1753; "Sir, I beg the favour of you
to present to the Royal Society the enclosed work,
which will receive great honour by their acceptance
of it. I am, Sir, your most obedient humble
servant, <span class="smcap">Wm. Hogarth</span>."</p>

<p>In this book, the leading idea of which was
hieroglyphically thrown out in a frontispiece to his
works in 1745, he acknowledges himself indebted
to his friends for assistance, and particularly to one
gentleman for his corrections and amendments of at
least a third part of the <i>wording</i>. This friend, I am
assured, was Dr. <i>Benjamin Hoadly</i> the physician, who
carried on the work to about a <i>third</i> part, Chap. IX.
and then, through indisposition, declined the friendly
office with regret. Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> applied to his neighbour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Mr. <i>Ralph</i>; but it was impossible for two such
persons to agree, both alike vain and positive. He
proceeded no farther than about a sheet, and they
then parted friends, and seem to have continued such.
In the <i>Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the
Times</i>, vol. I. p. 47, published in 1757 by Dr. <i>Brown</i>,
that author pays a compliment to Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> genius.
Mr. <i>Ralph</i>, animadverting on the work,
amongst other things, says, "It is happy for Mr.
<i>Hogarth</i>, in my humble opinion, that he is brought
upon the stage in such company, rather for the
sake of fastening some additional abuse upon the
public, than of bestowing any special grace upon
him. 'Neither the comic pencil, nor the serious
pen of our ingenious countrymen (so the Estimator
or Appraiser's Patent of Allowance runs)
have been able to keep alive the taste of Nature
or of Beauty.' For where he has chosen to be a
niggard of his acknowledgements, every other
man would chuse to be a prodigal: Nature had
played the <i>Proteus</i> with us, had invited us to
pursue her in every shape, but had never suffered
us to overtake her: Beauty all had been smitten
with, but nobody had been able to assign us a
rule by which it might be defined: This was Mr.
<i>Hogarth's</i> task; this is what he has succeeded in;
composition is at last become a science; the student
knows what he is in search of; the connoisseur
what to praise; and fancy or fashion, or
prescription, will usurp the hacknied name of taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
no more. So that, whatever may be said in disparagement
of the age on other accounts, it has
more merit and honour to claim on this, than any
which preceded it. And I will venture for once
to prophesy, from the improvements already manifested,
that we shall have the arts of designing
to value ourselves upon, when all our ancient virtues
are worn out."</p>

<p>The office of finishing the work, and superintending
the publication, was lastly taken up by Dr. <i>Morell</i>,
who went through the remainder of the book.<a name="FNanchor_40_58" id="FNanchor_40_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_58" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The preface was in like manner corrected by the
Rev. Mr. <i>Townley</i>. The family of <i>Hogarth</i> rejoiced
when the last sheet of the <i>Analysis</i> was printed off;
as the frequent disputes he had with his coadjutors,
in the progress of the work, did not much harmonize
his disposition.</p>

<p>This work was translated into <i>German</i> by Mr.
<i>Mylins</i>, when in <i>England</i>, under the author's inspection;
and the translation, containing twenty-two
sheets in quarto, and two large plates, was printed in
<i>London</i>, price five dollars.</p>

<p>Of the same performance a new and correct edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
was (<i>July</i> 1, 1754) proposed for publication at <i>Berlin</i>,
by <i>Ch. Fr. Vok</i>, with an explanation of Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i>
satirical prints, translated from the <i>French</i>;
the whole to subscribers for one dollar, but after six
weeks to be raised to two dollars.</p>

<p>An <i>Italian</i> translation was also published at <i>Leghorn</i>
in 1761, 8vo, dedicated "All' illustrissime Signora
Diana <i>Molineux</i>, Dama <i>Inglese</i>."</p>

<p>"This book," Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes, "had many
sensible hints and observations; but it did not
carry the conviction, nor meet the universal acquiescence
he expected. As he treated his contemporaries
with scorn, they triumphed over this
publication,<a name="FNanchor_41_59" id="FNanchor_41_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_59" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and irritated him to expose him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Many wretched burlesque prints came out to ridicule
his system. There was a better answer to
it in one of the two prints that he gave to illustrate
his hypothesis. In the ball, had he confined
himself to such outlines as compose awkwardness
and deformity, he would have proved half his
assertion; but he has added two samples of grace
in a young lord and lady, that are strikingly stiff
and affected. They are a <i>Bath</i> beau and a county
Beauty."</p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> had one failing in common with most
people who attain wealth and eminence without the
aid of liberal education. He affected to despise
every kind of knowledge which he did not possess.
Having established his fame with little or no obligation
to literature, he either conceived it to be needless,
or decried it because it lay out of his reach.
His sentiments, in short, resembled those of <i>Jack
Cade</i>, who pronounced sentence on the clerk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<i>Chatham</i>, because he could write and read. Till,
in evil hour, this celebrated artist commenced an
author, and was obliged to employ the friends already
mentioned to correct his <i>Analysis of Beauty</i>,<a name="FNanchor_42_60" id="FNanchor_42_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_60" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
he did not seem to have discovered that even spelling
was a necessary qualification; and yet he had ventured
to ridicule<a name="FNanchor_43_61" id="FNanchor_43_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_61" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> the late Mr. <i>Rich's</i> deficiency as
to this particular, in a note which lies before the
Rake whose play is refused while he remains in confinement
for debt. Previous to the time of which
we are now speaking, one of our artist's common
topicks of declamation was the uselessness of books
to a man of his profession. In <i>Beer-street</i>, among
other volumes consigned by him to the pastry cook,
we find <i>Turnbull on ancient Painting</i>, a treatise which
<i>Hogarth</i> should have been able to understand, before
he ventured to condemn. <i>Garrick</i> himself, however,
was not more ductile to flattery. A word in favour
of <i>Sigismunda</i>, might have commanded a proof print,
or forced an original sketch out of our artist's hands.
The furnisher of this remark owes one of his scarcest
performances to the success of a compliment, which
might have stuck even in Sir <i>Godfrey Kneller's</i> throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The following authenticated story of our artist
will also serve to shew how much more easy it is to
detect ill-placed or hyperbolical adulation respecting
others, than when applied to ourselves. <i>Hogarth</i>
being at dinner with the great <i>Cheselden</i>, and some
other company, was told that Mr. <i>John Freke</i>, surgeon
of <i>St. Bartholomew's Hospital</i>, a few evenings
before at <i>Dick's Coffee-house</i>, had asserted, that <i>Greene</i>
was as eminent in composition as <i>Handel</i>. "That
fellow <i>Freke</i>," replied <i>Hogarth</i>, "is always shooting
his bolt absurdly one way or another! <i>Handel</i> is a
giant in music; <i>Greene</i> only a light <i>Florimel</i> kind of
a composer."&mdash;"Ay," says our artist's informant,
"but at the same time Mr. <i>Freke</i> declared you were
as good a portrait-painter as <i>Vandyck</i>."&mdash;"<i>There</i> he
was in the right," adds <i>Hogarth</i>; "and so by G&mdash; I
am, give me my time, and let me choose my subject!"</p>

<p>With Dr. <i>Hoadly</i>, the late Chancellor of <i>Winchester</i>,
Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> was always on terms of the strictest
friendship, and frequently visited him at <i>Winchester,
St. Cross,</i> and <i>Alresford</i>. It is well known, that Dr.
<i>Hoadly's</i> fondness for theatrical exhibitions was so
great, that few visitors were ever long in his house
before they were solicited to accept a part in some
interlude or other. He himself, with <i>Garrick</i> and
<i>Hogarth</i>, once performed a laughable parody on the
scene in <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, where the <i>Ghost</i> appears to
<i>Brutus. Hogarth</i> personated the spectre; but so unretentive
was his memory, that, although his speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
consisted only of two lines, he was unable to get
them by heart. At last they hit on the following
expedient in his favour. The verses he was to deliver
were written in such large letters, on the outside
of an illuminated paper-lanthorn, that he could read
them when he entered with it in his hand on the
stage. <i>Hogarth</i> painted a scene on this occasion, representing
a sutling booth, with the <i>Duck of Cumberland's</i>
head by way of sign. He also prepared the
play-bill, with characteristic ornaments. The original
drawing is still preserved, and we could wish it
were engraved; as the slightest sketch from the
design of so grotesque a painter would be welcome
to the numerous collectors of his works.</p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> was also the most absent of men. At
table he would sometimes turn round his chair as if
he had finished eating, and as suddenly would return
it, and fall to his meal again. I may add, that he
once directed a letter to Dr. <i>Hoadly</i>, thus,&mdash;"To
the Doctor at <i>Chelsea</i>." This epistle, however,
by good luck, did not miscarry; and was preserved
by the late Chancellor of <i>Winchester</i>, as a pleasant
memorial of his friend's extraordinary inattention.</p>

<p>Another remarkable instance of <i>Hogarth's</i> absence
was told me, after the first edition of this work, by one
of his intimate friends. Soon after he set up his
carriage, he had occasion to pay a visit to the lord-mayor
(I believe it was Mr. <i>Beckford</i>). When he
went, the weather was fine; but business detained
him till a violent shower of rain came on. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
let out of the Mansion-house by a different door from
that at which he entered; and, seeing the rain, began
immediately to call for a hackney-coach. Not
one was to be met with on any of the neighbouring
stands; and our artist sallied forth to brave the
storm, and actually reached <i>Leicester-fields</i> without
bestowing a thought on his own carriage, till Mrs.
<i>Hogarth</i> (surprized to see him so wet and splashed)
asked where he had left it.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, in the following note, p. 69, is
willing to expose the indelicacy of the <i>Flemish</i> painters,
by comparing it with the purity of <i>Hogarth</i>.
"When they attempt humour," says our author,
"it is by making a drunkard vomit; they take evacuations
for jokes; and when they make us sick,
think they make us laugh. A boor hugging a
frightful frow is a frequent incident, even in the
works of <i>Teniers</i>." Shall we proceed to examine
whether the scenes painted by our countryman are
wholly free from the same indelicacies? In one plate
of <i>Hudibras</i>, where he encounters a <i>Skimmington</i>, a
man is making water against the end of a house,
while a taylor's wife is most significantly attending
to the dirty process. In another plate to the same
work, a boy is pissing into the shoe of <i>Ralpho</i>, while
the widow is standing by. Another boy in the <i>Enraged
Musician</i> is easing nature by the same mode;
and a little miss is looking earnestly on the operation.
In the <i>March to Finchley</i>, a diseased soldier has no
better employment; and a woman is likewise staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
at him out of a window. This circumstance did not
escape the observation of <i>Rouquet</i> the enameller,
whose remarks<a name="FNanchor_44_62" id="FNanchor_44_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_62" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> on the plates of our artist I shall have
more than once occasion to introduce. "Il y a,"
says he, "dans quelques endroits de cet excellent tableau,
des objets peut être plus propres à peindre
qu'à décrire. D'ou vient que les oreilles sont plus
chaste que les yeux? Ne seroit ce pas parce qu'on
peut regarder certains objets dans un tableau, et
feindre de ne pas les voir; et qu'il n'est pas si
aisé d'entendre une obscénité, et de feindre de ne
l'entendre pas! L'objet, dont je veux parler, est
toutefois peu considérable; il s'agit seulement d'un
soldat à qui le voyage de <i>Montpelier</i> conviendroit
mieux que celui d'<i>Ecosse</i>. L'amour lui a fait une
blessure, &amp;c." Was this occurrence delicate or precious
enough to deserve such frequency of repetition?
In the burlesque <i>Paul before Felix</i>, when the High
Priest applies his fingers to his nose, we have reason
to imagine that his manœuvre was in consequence of
some offensive escape during the terrors of the pro-consul
of <i>Judea</i>, who, as he is here represented,
conveys no imperfect image of a late Lord Mayor,
at the time of the riots in <i>London</i>. In this last instance,
indeed, I ought to have observed that <i>Hogarth</i>
meant to satirize, not to imitate, the painters of <i>Holland</i>
and <i>Flanders</i>. But I forbear to dwell any longer
on such disgusting circumstances; begging leave only
to ask, whether the canvas of <i>Teniers</i> exhibits nastier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
objects than those of the woman cracking a louse
between her nails in the fourth plate of the <i>Harlot's
Progress</i>; a <i>Scotch</i> bag-piper catching another in his
neck while he is performing at the Election feast;
<i>Aurora</i> doing the same kind office for a <i>Syren</i> or <i>Nereid</i>,
in the <i>Strollers</i>, &amp;c.; the old toothless <i>French</i> beldams,
slobbering (<i>Venus</i> forbid we should call it kissing)
each other in the comic print entitled <i>Noon</i>;
the chamber-pot emptied on the Free Mason's head,
in the <i>Rejoicing Night</i>; or the <i>Lilliputians</i> giving a
clyster to <i>Gulliver</i>? In some of these instances, however,
the humour may compensate for the indelicacy,
which is rarely the case with such <i>Dutch</i> pictures as
have justly incurred the censure of Mr. <i>Walpole</i>.
Let us now try how far some of the compositions of
<i>Hogarth</i> have befriended the cause of modesty. In
the <i>Harlot's Progress</i>, Plate VI. we meet with a hand
by no means busied in manner suitable to the purity
of its owner's function. <i>Hogarth</i> indeed, in
three different works, has delineated three clergymen;
the one as a drunkard; the second as a glutton;
and the third as a whoremaster, who (I borrow
<i>Rouquet's</i> words) "est plus occupé de sa voisine que
de son vin, qu'il repand par une distraction qu'elle
lui cause." He who, in the eyes of the vulgar,
would degrade our professors of religion, deserves
few thanks from society. In the <i>Rake's Progress</i>,
Plate the last, how is the hand of the ideal
potentate employed, while he is gazing with no very
modest aspect on a couple of young women who pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
before his cell numbered 55? and to what particular
object are the eyes of the said females supposed to
be directed?<a name="FNanchor_45_63" id="FNanchor_45_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_63" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Nay, in what pursuit is the grenadier
engaged who stands with his face toward the wall in
Plate 9. of <i>Industry and Idleness</i>? May we address another
question to the reader? Is the "<i>smile</i> of <i>Socrates</i>,"
or the "<i>benevolence</i> of the designer," very distinguishable
in the half dozen last instances? It has been observed
indeed by physiognomists, that the <i>smile</i> of
the real <i>Socrates</i> resembled the <i>grin</i> of a <i>satyr</i>; and
perhaps a few of the particulars here alluded to, as
well as the prints entitled <span class="smcap">Before</span> and <span class="smcap">After</span>, ought
to be considered as a <i>benevolence</i> to speculative old
maids, or misses not yet enfranchised from a boarding
school. Had this truly sensible critic, and elegant
writer, been content to observe, that such gross circumstances
as form the chief subject of <i>Flemish</i>
pictures, are only incidental and subordinate in those
of our artist, the remark might have escaped reprehension.
But perhaps he who has told us that "<i>St.
Paul's</i> hand was once <i>improperly</i> placed before the
wife of <i>Felix</i>" should not have suffered more
glaring insults on decency to pass without a censure.
On this occasion, though I may be found to differ
from Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, I am ready to confess how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
regard is due to the opinions of a gentleman whose
mind has been long exercised on a subject which is
almost new to me; especially when I recollect that
my present researches would have had no guide, but
for the lights held out in the last volume of the
Anecdotes of Painting in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> boasted that he could draw a Serjeant with
his pike, going into an alehouse, and his Dog following
him, with only three strokes;&mdash;which he executed
thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 135px;">
<img src="images/page_63_illus.jpg" width="135" height="192" alt="Hogarth's drawing in three lines" />
</div>

<p>A. The perspective line of the door.<br />
B. The end of the Serjeant's pike, who is gone in.<br />
C. The end of the Dog's tail, who is following him.<br />
There are similar whims of the <i>Caracci</i>.</p>

<p>A specimen of <i>Hogarth's</i> propensity to merriment,
on the most trivial occasions, is observable in one of
his cards requesting the company of Dr. <i>Arnold King</i>
to dine with him at the <i>Mitre</i>.<a name="FNanchor_46_64" id="FNanchor_46_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_64" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Within a circle, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
which a knife and fork are the supporters, the
written part is contained. In the center is drawn a
pye, with a <i>mitre</i> on the top of it; and the invitation
of our artist concludes with the following sport
on three of the <i>Greek</i> letters&mdash;to <i>Eta Beta Pi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_65" id="FNanchor_47_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_65" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The
rest of the inscription is not very accurately spelt.
A quibble by <i>Hogarth</i> is surely as respectable as a
conundrum by <i>Swift</i>.</p>

<p>"Some nicer virtuosi have remarked, that in the
serious pieces, into which <i>Hogarth</i> has deviated
from the natural biass of his genius, there are
some strokes of the ridiculous discernible, which
suit not with the dignity of his subject. In his
<span class="smcap">preaching of St. Paul</span>, a dog snarling at a cat;<a name="FNanchor_48_66" id="FNanchor_48_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_66" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
and in his <span class="smcap">Pharaoh's Daughter</span>, the figure of
the infant <i>Moses</i>, who expresses rather archness
than timidity; are alledged as instances, that this
artist, unrivalled in his own walk, could not resist
the impulse of his imagination towards drollery.
His picture, however, of <i>Richard</i> III. is pure and
unmixed, without any ridiculous circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and strongly impresses terror and amazement." As
these observations are extracted from the <i>first</i> edition
of Dr. <i>Warton's</i> "Essay on the Genius and Writings
of <i>Pope</i>," it would be uncandid if we did not accompany
them with the following note from a subsequent
edition of that valuable performance: "The
author gladly lays hold of the opportunity of this
third edition of his work to confess a mistake he had
committed with respect to two admirable paintings
of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, his <span class="smcap">Paul Preaching</span>, and his
<span class="smcap">Infant Moses</span>; which, on a closer examination,
are not chargeable with the blemishes imputed to
them. Justice obliges him to declare the high
opinion he entertains of the abilities of this inimitable
artist, who shines in so many different
lights, and on such very dissimilar subjects; and
whose works have more of what the ancients
called the ΗθΟΣ [Greek: Ethos] in them, than the compositions
of any other Modern. For the rest, the author
begs leave to add, that he is so far from being
ashamed of retracting his error, that he had rather
appear a <span class="smcap">Man of Candour</span>, than the best
<span class="smcap">Critic</span> that ever lived."<a name="FNanchor_49_67" id="FNanchor_49_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_67" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In one of the early exhibitions at <i>Spring Gardens</i>,
a very pleasing small picture by <i>Hogarth</i> made its
first appearance. It was painted for the earl of
<i>Charlemont</i>, in whose collection it remains.<a name="FNanchor_50_68" id="FNanchor_50_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_68" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It was
intituled, <i>Picquet, or Virtue in Danger,</i> and shews
us a young lady, who, during a <i>tête-à-tête</i>, had just
lost all her money to a handsome officer of her own
age. He is represented in the act of returning her
a handful of bank bills, with the hope of exchanging
them for a softer acquisition, and more delicate
plunder. On the chimney piece is a watch-case and
a figure of Time over it, with this motto&mdash;NUNC.
<i>Hogarth</i> has caught his heroine during this moment
of hesitation, this struggle with herself, and has
marked her feelings with uncommon success. Wavering
chastity, as in this instance, he was qualified
to display; but the graceful reserve of steady and
exalted virtue he would certainly have failed to express.
He might have conveyed a perfect idea of
such an <i>Iphigenia</i> as is described by Mr. <i>Hayley</i>, in
one of the cantoes of his beautiful poem on the
<i>Triumphs of Temper</i>; but the dignity of the same female
at the <i>Tauric</i> altar would have baffled the most
vigorous efforts of his pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hogarth's</i> Picquet, or <i>Virtue in Danger</i>, when exhibited
at <i>Spring Gardens</i>, in <i>May</i>, 1761, produced
the following explanation:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ye fair, be warn'd, and shun those arts,<br />
That faithless men do use for hearts:<br />
Weigh o'er and o'er the destin'd man,<br />
And oft this little lesson scan;<br />
If he his character don't fear,<br />
For yours he'll very little care:<br />
With scorn repulse the wretch so bold,<br />
Nor pawn your virtue for his gold!<br />
Of gaming (cards or not) beware,<br />
'Tis very often found a snare;<br />
But, lest my precept still should fail,<br />
Indulge me&mdash;whilst I tell a tale:<br />
<br />
<i>Dorinda</i>, chearful, young, and gay,<br />
Oft shone at Balls, at Park, and Play;<br />
Blest with a free, engaging air,<br />
In short, throughout quite debonnair;<br />
(Excuse me&mdash;shall I tell the truth?)<br />
That bane of misled, heedless youth,<br />
Gaming&mdash;had quite possess'd her mind,<br />
To this (no other vice) inclin'd:<br />
She oft would melancholy sit,<br />
No partner near for dear Picquet!<br />
"At last a cruel spoiler came,"<br />
And deeply learn'd in all the game;<br />
A son of <i>Mars</i>, with iron face,<br />
Adorn'd with impudence and lace!<br />
Acquaintance with her soon he gains,<br />
He thinks her virtue worth his pains:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Cards (after nonsense) came in course,<br />
By sap advances, not by force.<br />
The table set, the cards are laid,<br />
<i>Dorinda</i> dreams not she's betray'd;<br />
The cards run cross, she fumes and frets,<br />
Her brilliant necklace soon she betts,<br />
She fears her watch, but can't resist,<br />
A miniature can scarce be mist!<br />
At last both watch and trinkets go,<br />
A prey to the devouring foe:<br />
Nay more (if fame but tells us true),<br />
She lost her di'mond buckles too!<br />
Her bracelets next became his prize,<br />
And in his hat the treasure lies.<br />
Upon her Virtue next he treats,<br />
And Honour's sacred name repeats:<br />
Tenders the trinkets, swears and lies,<br />
And vows her person is a prize!<br />
Then swears (with hand upon his breast)<br />
That he without her can't be blest!<br />
Then plies her with redoubled pains,<br />
T' exchange her virtue for his gains:<br />
Shame's purple wings o'ershade her face,<br />
He triumphs over her disgrace;<br />
Soon turns to jest her scruples nice,<br />
In short, she falls!&mdash;a sacrifice!<br />
Spoil'd of her virtue in her prime,<br />
And, knowing Heaven detests the crime,<br />
Is urg'd, perhaps, to dare his rod,<br />
"And rush unsummon'd to her God!"<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Ye fair, if happiness ye prize,<br />
Regard this rule, Be timely wise.<br />

<p>In the "Miser's Feast," Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> thought
proper to pillory Sir <i>Isaac Shard</i>, a gentleman proverbially
avaricious. Hearing this, the son of Sir
<i>Isaac</i>, the late <i>Isaac Pacatus Shard</i>,<a name="FNanchor_51_69" id="FNanchor_51_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_69" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> esq. a young
man of spirit, just returned from his travels, called
at the painter's to see the picture; and, among the
rest, asking the <i>Cicerone</i> "whether that odd figure
was intended for any particular person;" on his
replying, "that it was thought to be very like one
Sir <i>Isaac Shard</i>;" he immediately drew his sword,
and slashed the canvas. <i>Hogarth</i> appeared instantly
in great wrath; to whom Mr. <i>Shard</i> calmly justified
what he had done, saying, "that this was a very
unwarrantable licence; that he was the injured
party's son, and that he was ready to defend any
suit at law;" which, however, was never instituted.</p>

<p>About 1757, his brother-in-law, Mr. <i>Thornhill</i>,
resigned the place of king's serjeant-painter in favour
of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>; who soon after made an experiment
in painting, which involved him in some disgrace.
The celebrated collection of pictures belonging
to Sir <i>Luke Schaub</i> was in 1758 sold by public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
auction;<a name="FNanchor_52_70" id="FNanchor_52_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_70" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and the admired picture of <i>Sigismunda</i>
(purchased by Sir <i>Thomas Sebright</i> for 404. <i>l.</i> 5 <i>s.</i>)
excited Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> emulation.</p>

<p>"From a contempt of the ignorant virtuosi of
the age," says Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, "and from indignation
at the impudent tricks of picture-dealers,
whom he saw continually recommending and
vending vile copies to bubble collectors, and from
having never studied, indeed having seen, few
good pictures of the great <i>Italian</i> masters, he persuaded
himself that the praises bestowed on those
glorious works were nothing but the effects of
prejudice. He talked this language till he believed
it; and having heard it often asserted, as is
true, that time gives a mellowness to colours and
improves them, he not only denied the proposition,
but maintained that pictures only grew
black and worse by age, not distinguishing between
the degrees in which the proportion might
be true or false. He went farther: he determined
to rival the ancients&mdash;and unfortunately chose one
of the finest pictures in <i>England</i> as the object of
his competition. This was the celebrated <i>Sigismunda</i>
of Sir <i>Luke Schaub</i>, now in the possession
of the Duke of <i>Newcastle</i>, said to be painted by
<i>Correggio</i>, probably by <i>Furino</i>, but no matter by
whom. It is impossible to see the picture, or read
<i>Dryden's</i> inimitable tale, and not feel that the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
soul animated both. After many essays, <i>Hogarth</i>
at last produced <span class="smcap">HIS</span> <i>Sigismunda</i>&mdash;but no more like
<i>Sigismunda</i>, than I to <i>Hercules</i>. Not to mention
the wretchedness of the colouring, it was the representation
of a maudlin strumpet just turned out
of keeping, and, with eyes red with rage and
usquebaugh, tearing off the ornaments her keeper
had given her. To add to the disgust raised by
such vulgar expression, her fingers were bloodied
by her lover's heart,<a name="FNanchor_53_71" id="FNanchor_53_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_71" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> that lay before her, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
that of a sheep, for her dinner.<a name="FNanchor_54_72" id="FNanchor_54_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_72" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> None of the
sober grief, no dignity of suppressed anguish, no
involuntary tear, no settled meditation on the fate
she meant to meet, no amorous warmth turned
holy by despair; in short, all was wanting that
should have been there, all was there that such a
story would have banished from a mind capable of
conceiving such complicated woe; woe so sternly
felt, and yet so tenderly. <i>Hogarth's</i> performance
was more ridiculous than any thing he had ever
ridiculed. He set the price of 400 <i>l.</i> on it, and
had it returned on his hands by the person for
whom it was painted. He took subscriptions for
a plate of it; but had the sense, at last, to suppress
it. I make no more apology for this account
than for the encomiums I have bestowed on him.
Both are dictated by truth, and are the history of
a great man's excellencies and errors. <i>Milton</i>, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
is said, preferred his <i>Paradise Regained</i> to his immortal
poem."<a name="FNanchor_55_73" id="FNanchor_55_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_73" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i>, however, gave directions before his death
that the <i>Sigismunda</i> should not be sold under 500 <i>l.</i>
and, greatly as he might have been mortified by
<i>Churchill's</i> invective, and the coldness with which
the picture was received by the rest of the world,<a name="FNanchor_56_74" id="FNanchor_56_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_74" class="fnanchor">[56]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
he never wholly abandoned his design of having a
plate prepared from it. Finding abundant consolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
in the flattery of self-love, he appealed from the
public judgement to his own, and had actually talked
with the celebrated Mr. <i>Hall</i> about the price of the
engraving, which was to have been executed from a
smaller painting,<a name="FNanchor_57_75" id="FNanchor_57_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_75" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> copied by himself from the large
one. Death alone secured him from the contempt
such obstinacy would have riveted on his name. To
express a sorrow like that of <i>Tancred's</i> daughter, few
modern artists are fully qualified. We must except
indeed Sir <i>Joshua Reynolds</i>, with whose pencil Beauty
in all her forms, and the passions in all their varieties,
are equally familiar.</p>

<p>Since the preceding paragraph was written, the
compiler of this volume has seen an unfinished
plate of <i>Sigismunda</i>, attempted after the manner of
<i>Edelinck</i>, etched by Mr. <i>Basire</i>, but not bit-in, and
from which consequently no proof can have been
taken. The size of the plate is 18 inches by 16½.
The outlines in general, and particularly of the
face, were completed under the immediate direction
of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_58_76" id="FNanchor_58_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_76" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It was intended to be published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
by subscription.<a name="FNanchor_59_77" id="FNanchor_59_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_77" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The plate itself is still in the
hands of Mr. <i>Basire</i>.</p>

<p>This unfortunate picture, which was the source of
so much vexation to Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, at least made a
versifier of him, and furnished vent to his anger in
the following lines; which, as I know of no other
specimen of his poetry,<a name="FNanchor_60_78" id="FNanchor_60_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_78" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> may serve to gratify the
curiosity of the reader. The old adage <i>facit indignatio
versum</i>, seems scarcely to have been realised in
this splenetic effusion, which is intituled "An Epistle
to a Friend," occasioned by Sir <i>Richard Grosvenor</i>
(now lord) returning the picture of <i>Sigismunda</i> on
our artist's hands:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
"To your charge, the other day<br />
About my picture and my pay,<br />
In metre I've a mind to try,<br />
One word by way of a reply.<br />
<br />
"To risque, you'll own, 'twas most absurd,<br />
Such labour on a rich man's word;<br />
To lose at least an hundred days<br />
Of certain gain, for doubtful praise;<br />
Since living artists ne'er were paid;<br />
But then, you know, it was agreed,<br />
I should be deem'd an artist dead.<br />
Like <i>Raphael, Rubens, Guido Rene,</i><br />
This promise fairly drew me in;<br />
And having laid my pencil by,<a name="FNanchor_61_80" id="FNanchor_61_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_80" class="fnanchor">[61]</a><br />
What painter was more dead than I?<br />
But dead as <i>Guido</i> let me be,<br />
Then judge, my friend, 'twixt him and me<br />
If merit crowns alike the piece,<br />
What treason to be like in price;<br />
Because no copied line you trace,<br />
The picture can't be right, you're sure;<br />
But say, my critic connoisseur,<br />
Moves it the heart as much or more<br />
Than picture ever did before?<br />
This is the painter's truest test,<br />
And this Sir <i>Richard's</i> self confess'd.<br />
Nay, 'tis so moving, that the knight<br />
Can't even bear it in his sight;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>Then who would tears so dearly buy,<br />
As give four hundred pounds to cry?<br />
I own, he chose the prudent part,<br />
Rather to break his word than heart;<br />
And yet, methinks, 'tis ticklish dealing,<br />
With one so delicate&mdash;in feeling.<br />
<br />
"However, let the picture rust,<br />
Perhaps time's price-enhancing dust,<br />
As statues moulder into earth,<br />
When I'm no more, may mark its worth;<br />
And future connoisseurs may rise,<br />
Honest as ours, and full as wise,<br />
To puff the piece and painter too,<br />
And make me then what <i>Guido's</i> now."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"The last memorable event in our artist's life,"
as Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes, "was his quarrel with Mr.
<i>Wilkes</i>, in which, if Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> did not commence
direct hostilities on the latter, he at least
obliquely gave the first offence, by an attack on
the friends and party of that gentleman. This
conduct was the more surprizing, as he had all
his life avoided dipping his pencil in political
contests, and had early refused a very lucrative
offer that was made to engage him in a set of
prints against the head of a court-party. Without
entering into the merits of the cause, I shall only
state the fact. In <i>September</i> 1762, Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> published
his print of <i>The Times</i>. It was answered
by Mr. <i>Wilkes</i> in a severe <i>North Briton</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62_81" id="FNanchor_62_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_81" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the painter exhibited the caricatura of the writer.
Mr. <i>Churchill</i>, the poet, then engaged in the war,
and wrote his epistle to <i>Hogarth</i>, not the brightest
of his works,<a name="FNanchor_63_82" id="FNanchor_63_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_82" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> in which the severest strokes
fell on a defect that the painter had neither caused
nor could amend&mdash;his age;<a name="FNanchor_64_83" id="FNanchor_64_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_83" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and which, however,
was neither remarkable nor decrepit; much
less had it impaired his talents, as appeared by his
having composed but six months before one of
his most capital works, the satire on the Methodists.
In revenge for this epistle, <i>Hogarth</i> caricatured
<i>Churchill</i>, under the form of a canonical bear,
with a club and a pot of porter&mdash;<i>et vitulá tu dignus
&amp; hic</i>&mdash;never did two angry men of their abilities
throw mud with less dexterity."</p>

<p>The concluding observation of Mr. <i>Walpole</i> is mortifyingly
true. It may be amusing to compare the
account given of this squabble, which long engrossed
the attention of the town, with the narrative of it
printed by Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>; who states the circumstances
of it in the following manner:</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> was one of the first who, in the
paper war begun by lord <i>Bute</i> on his accession to
the Treasury, sacrificed private friendship at the
altar of party madness. In 1762, the <i>Scotch</i> minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
took a variety of hirelings into his pay,
some of whom were gratified with pensions, others
with places and pensions. Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> was only
made <i>serjeant-painter</i> to his majesty, as if it was
meant to insinuate to him, that he was not allowed
to paint any thing but the wainscot of the royal
apartments. The term means no more than <i>house-painter</i>,
and the nature of the post confined him
to that business. He was not employed in any
other way. A circumstance can scarcely be imagined
more humiliating to a man of spirit and
genius, who really thought that he more particularly
excelled in <i>portrait-painting</i>.</p>

<p>"The new minister had been attacked in a variety
of political papers. <i>The North Briton</i> in particular,
which commenced the week after <i>The Briton</i>,
waged open war with him. Some of the numbers
had been ascribed to Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>, others to Mr.
<i>Churchill</i>, and Mr. <i>Lloyd</i>. Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> had for
several years lived on terms of friendship and intimacy
with Mr. <i>Churchill</i> and Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>. As the
<i>Buckinghamshire</i> militia, which this gentleman had
the honour of commanding, had been for some
months at <i>Winchester</i> guarding the <i>French</i> prisoners,
the Colonel was there on that duty. A friend
wrote to him, that Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> intended soon to
publish a political print of <i>The Times</i>, in which
Mr. <i>Pitt</i>, Lord <i>Temple</i>, Mr. <i>Churchill</i>, and himself,
were held out to the public as objects of ridicule.
Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>, on this notice, remonstrated by two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
their common friends to Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, that such a
proceeding would not only be unfriendly in the
highest degree, but extremely injudicious; for
such a pencil ought to be universal and moral, to
speak to all ages, and to all nations, not to be dipt
in the dirt of the faction of a day, of an insignificant
part of the country, when it might command
the admiration of the whole. An answer was sent,
that neither Mr. <i>Wilkes</i> nor Mr. <i>Churchill</i> were attacked
in <i>The Times</i>, though Lord <i>Temple</i> and Mr.
<i>Pitt</i> were, and that the print should soon appear.
A second message soon after told Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, that
Mr. <i>Wilkes</i> should never believe it worth his while
to take notice of any reflections on himself; but
if his friends were attacked, he should then think
he was wounded in the most sensible part, and
would, as well as he was able, revenge their cause;
adding, that if he thought the <i>North Briton</i> would
insert what he sent, he would make an appeal to
the public on the very <i>Saturday</i> following the publication
of the print. <i>The Times</i> soon after appeared,
and on the <i>Saturday</i> following [<i>Sept.</i> 25,
1762,] N° 17, of the <i>North Briton</i>, which is a direct
attack on the king's <i>serjeant-painter</i>.<a name="FNanchor_65_84" id="FNanchor_65_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_84" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Mr. <i>Wilkes</i> did write that paper, he kept his word
better with Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, than the painter had
done with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is perhaps worth remarking, that the painter
proposed to give a series of political prints, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
that <i>The Times</i> were marked Plate I. No farther
progress was however made in that design. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
public beheld the first feeble efforts with execrations,
and it is said that the caricaturist was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
much hurt by the general opinion of mankind, to
possess himself afterwards sufficiently for the execution
of such a work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"When Mr. <i>Wilkes</i> was the second time brought
from the <i>Tower</i> to <i>Westminster-hall</i>, Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>
skulked behind in a corner of the gallery of the
Court of <i>Common Pleas</i>; and while the Chief Justice <i>Pratt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_66_86" id="FNanchor_66_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_86" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
with the eloquence and courage of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<i>Rome</i>, was enforcing the great principles of <i>Magna
Charta</i>, and the <i>English</i> constitution, while every
breast from him caught the holy flame of liberty,
the painter was wholly employed in caricaturing
the <i>person</i> of the man; while all the rest of his
fellow citizens were animated in his <i>cause</i>, for they
knew it to be their own cause, that of their country,
and of its laws. It was declared to be so a
few hours after by the unanimous sentence of the
judges of that court, and they were all present.</p>

<p>"The print of Mr. <i>Wilkes</i> was soon after published,
<i>drawn from the life by William Hogarth</i>. It
must be allowed to be an excellent <i>compound caricatura</i>,
or a <i>caricatura</i> of what nature had already
<i>caricatured</i>. I know but one short apology can be
made for this gentleman, or, to speak more properly,
for the <i>person</i> of Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>. It is, that
he did not make himself, and that he never was
solicitous about the <i>case</i> of his soul, as <i>Shakspeare</i>
calls it, only so far as to keep it clean and in
health. I never heard that he once hung over the
glassy stream, like another <i>Narcissus</i>, admiring the
image in it, nor that he ever stole an amorous
look at his counterfeit in a side mirrour. His
form, such as it is, ought to give him no pain,
because it is capable of giving pleasure to others.
I fancy he finds himself tolerably happy in the
<i>clay-cottage</i>, to which he is <i>tenant for life</i>, because
he has learnt to keep it in good order. While
the share of health and animal spirits, which heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
has given him, shall hold out, I can scarcely
imagine he will be one moment peevish about the
<i>outside</i> of so precarious, so temporary a habitation,
or will even be brought to own, <i>ingenium Galbæ
male habitat. Monsieur est mal logé.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Churchill</i> was exasperated at this <i>personal</i>
attack on his friend. He soon after published the
Epistle to <i>William Hogarth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67_87" id="FNanchor_67_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_87" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and took for the motto,
<i>ut pictura poesis</i>. Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> revenge against
the poet terminated in vamping up an old print of
a pug-dog and a bear, which he published under
the title of The Bruiser <i>C. Churchill</i> (once the
Revd.!) in the character of a <i>Russian Hercules</i>,
&amp;c."</p>

<p>The Editor of the <i>Monthly Review</i> for <i>November</i>,
1769, in an account of Mr. <i>Wilkes's</i> correspondence,
remarks, "The writer of this article had in substance
the same relation from the mouth of Mr.
<i>Hogarth</i> himself, but a very little while before his
death;<a name="FNanchor_68_88" id="FNanchor_68_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_88" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and the leading facts appeared, from his
candid representation, in nearly the same light as
in this account which our readers have been just
perusing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been assured by the friend<a name="FNanchor_69_89" id="FNanchor_69_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_89" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> who first carried
and read the invective of <i>Churchill</i> to <i>Hogarth</i>, that
he seemed quite insensible to the most sarcastical
parts of it. He was so thoroughly wounded before
by the <i>North Briton</i>, especially with regard to what
related to domestic happiness, that he lay no where
open to a fresh stroke. Some readers, however, may
entertain a doubt on this subject. A man feels most
exquisitely when the merit of which he is proudest is
denied him; and it might be urged, that <i>Hogarth</i>
was more solicitous to maintain the character of a
good painter, than of a tender husband.</p>

<p>One quotation, however, from <i>Churchill's</i> Epistle
the warmest admirers of our matchless artist must be
pleased with:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"In walks of humour, in that cast of style,<br />
Which, probing to the quick, yet makes us smile;<br />
In Comedy, his natural road to fame,<br />
Nor let me call it by a meaner name,<br />
Where a beginning, middle, and an end,<br />
Are aptly join'd; where parts on parts depend,<br />
Each made for each, as bodies for their soul,<br />
So as to form one true and perfect whole,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Where a plain story to the eye is told,<br />
Which we conceive the moment we behold;<a name="FNanchor_70_90" id="FNanchor_70_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_90" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><br />
<i>Hogarth</i> unrival'd stands, and shall engage<br />
Unrival'd praise to the most distant age."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> having been said to be in his dotage when,
he produced his print of the Bear, it should seem as
if he had been provoked to make the following additions
to this print, in order to give a further specimen
of his still existing genius.</p>

<p>In the form of a framed picture on the painter's
palette, he has represented an <i>Egyptian</i> pyramid, on
the side of which is a <i>Cheshire</i> cheese,<a name="FNanchor_71_91" id="FNanchor_71_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_91" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and round it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
3000 <i>l. per annum</i>; and at the foot a <i>Roman</i> Veteran
in a reclining posture, designed as an allusion
to Mr. <i>Pitt's</i> resignation. The cheese is meant to
allude to a former speech of his, wherein he said
that he would rather subsist a week on a <i>Cheshire</i>
cheese and a shoulder of mutton, than submit to the
implacable enemies of his country.</p>

<p>But to ridicule this character still more, he is, as
he lies down, firing a piece of ordnance at the standard
of <i>Britain</i>, on which is a dove with an olive-branch,
the emblem of peace. On one side of the
pyramid is the City of <i>London</i>, represented by the
figure of one of the <i>Guildhall</i> giants, going to crown
the reclining hero. On the other side is the king of
<i>Prussia</i>, in the character of one of the <i>Cæsars</i>, but
smoking his pipe. In the center stands <i>Hogarth</i>
himself, whipping a Dancing Bear (<i>Churchill</i>) which
he holds in a string. At the side of the Bear is a
Monkey, designed for Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>. Between the legs
of the little animal is a mop-stick, on which he
seems to ride, as children do on a hobby-horse: at
the top of the mop-stick is the cap of liberty. The
Monkey is undergoing the same discipline as the
Bear. Behind the Monkey is the figure of a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
but with no lineaments of face, and playing on a
fiddle. This was designed for Earl <i>Temple</i>.</p>

<p>At the time these hostilities were carrying on in a
manner so virulent and disgraceful to all the parties,
<i>Hogarth</i> was visibly declining in his health. In
1762, he complained of an inward pain, which,
continuing, brought on a general decay that proved
incurable.<a name="FNanchor_72_92" id="FNanchor_72_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_92" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This last year of his life he employed
in retouching his plates with the assistance of several
engravers whom he took with him to <i>Chiswick</i>. On
the 25th of <i>October</i>, 1764, he was conveyed from
thence to <i>Leicester-fields</i>, in a very weak condition,
yet remarkably chearful; and, receiving an agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
letter from the <i>American</i> Dr. <i>Franklin</i>, drew up a
rough draught of an answer to it; but going to bed,
he was seized with a vomiting, upon which he rung
his bell with such violence that he broke it, and
expired about two hours afterwards in the arms of
Mrs. <i>Mary Lewis</i>, who was called up on his being
taken suddenly ill. To this lady, for her faithful
services, he bequeathed 100 <i>l.</i> After the death of
<i>Hogarth's</i> sister, Mrs. <i>Lewis</i> succeeded to the care of
his prints; and, without violation of truth, it may
be observed, that her good nature and affability recommend
these performances which she continues to
dispose of at Mrs. <i>Hogarth's</i> house in <i>Leicester-square</i>.
Before our artist went to bed, he boasted of having
eaten a pound of beef-steaks for his dinner,<a name="FNanchor_73_93" id="FNanchor_73_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_93" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and
was to all appearance heartier than he had been for
a long time before. His disorder was an aneurism;
and his corpse was interred in the church-yard at
<i>Chiswick</i>, where a monument is erected to his
memory, with this inscription, under his family
arms:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
"Here lieth the body<br />
Of <i>William Hogarth</i>, Esq.<br />
Who died <i>October</i> the 26th, 1764;<br />
Aged 67 years."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>On another side, which is ornamented with a
masque, a laurel wreath, a palette, pencils, and a
book, inscribed "Analysis of Beauty," are the following
verses by his friend Mr. <i>Garrick</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Farewell, great painter of mankind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who reach'd the noblest point of art;</span><br />
Whose pictur'd morals charm the mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And through the eye correct the heart.</span><br />
If <i>genius</i> fire thee, reader, stay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If <i>nature</i> touch thee, drop a tear;</span><br />
If neither move thee, turn away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For <i>Hogarth's</i> honoured dust lies here."</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>On a third side is this inscription:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
"Here lieth the body<br />
Of Dame <i>Judith Thornhill</i>,<br />
Relict of Sir <i>James Thornhill</i>, knight,<br />
Of <i>Thornhill</i> in the county of <i>Dorset</i>.<br />
She died <i>November</i> the 12th, 1757,<br />
Aged 84 years."<br />
</p>

<p>And on the fourth side:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
"Here lieth the body<br />
Of Mrs. <i>Anne Hogarth</i>, sister<br />
to <i>William Hogarth</i>, Esq.<br />
She died <i>August</i> the 13th, 1771,<br />
Aged 70 years."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hayley</i>, in his justly admired <i>Epistle to an
Eminent Painter</i> (Mr. <i>Romney</i>), has since expressed
himself concerning our artist in terms that confer
yet higher honours on his comic excellence:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Nor, if her favour'd hand may hope to shed<br />
The flowers of glory o'er the skilful dead,<br />
Thy talents, <i>Hogarth!</i> will she leave unsung;<br />
Charm of all eyes, and Theme of every tongue!<br />
A separate province 'twas thy praise to rule;<br />
Self-form'd thy Pencil! yet thy works a School,<br />
Where strongly painted, in gradations nice,<br />
The Pomp of Folly, and the Shame of Vice,<br />
Reach'd thro' the laughing Eye the mended Mind,<br />
And moral Humour sportive Art refin'd.<br />
While fleeting Manners, as minutely shown<br />
As the clear prospect on the mirror thrown;<br />
While Truth of Character, exactly hit,<br />
And drest in all the dyes of comic wit;<br />
While these, in <i>Fielding's</i> page, delights supply,<br />
So long thy Pencil with his Pen shall vie.<br />
Science with grief beheld thy drooping age<br />
Fall the sad victim of a Poet's rage:<br />
But Wit's vindictive spleen, that mocks controul,<br />
Nature's high tax on luxury of soul!<br />
This, both in Bards and Painters, Fame forgives<br />
Their Frailty's buried, but their Genius lives."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus far the encomiast, who seeks only for opportunities
of bestowing praise. A more impartial narrative
will be expected from the biographer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be truly observed of <i>Hogarth</i>, that all his
powers of delighting were restrained to his pencil.<a name="FNanchor_74_94" id="FNanchor_74_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_94" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Having rarely been admitted into polite circles, none
of his sharp corners had been rubbed off, so that he
continued to the last a gross uncultivated man.
The slightest contradiction transported him into rage.
To be member of a Club consisting of mechanics, or
those not many removes above them, seems to have
been the utmost of his social ambition; but even in
these assemblies he was oftener sent to <i>Coventry</i> for misbehaviour,
than any other person who frequented
them. To some confidence in himself he was certainly
entitled; for, as a comic painter, he could have
claimed no honour that would not most readily have
been allowed him;<a name="FNanchor_75_95" id="FNanchor_75_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_95" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> but he was at once unprincipled
and variable in his political conduct and attachments.
He is also said to have beheld the rising
eminence and popularity of Sir <i>Joshua Reynolds</i> with
a degree of envy; and, if I am not misinformed,
frequently spoke with asperity both of him and his
performances. Justice, however, obliges me to add,
that our artist was liberal, hospitable, and the most
punctual of pay-masters; so that, in spite of the emoluments
his works had procured to him, he left but an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
inconsiderable fortune to his widow. His plates indeed
are such resources as may not speedily be exhausted.
Some of his domestics had lived many
years in his service, a circumstance that always reflects
credit on a master. Of most of these he
painted strong likenesses on a canvas still in Mrs.
<i>Hogarth's</i> possession.</p>

<p>His widow has also a portrait of her husband,
and an excellent bust of him by <i>Roubilliac</i>, a strong
resemblance; and one of his brother-in-law Mr.
<i>Thornhill</i>, much resembling the countenance of Mrs.
<i>Hogarth</i>. Several of his portraits also remain in her
possession: <i>viz.</i> a finished portrait of Mrs. <i>Mary Lewis</i>;
<i>Thomas Coombes</i> of <i>Dorsetshire</i>, aged 108; Lady <i>Thornhill</i>;
Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i> herself, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>A portrait of <i>Hogarth</i> with his hat on, painted for
the late Rev. Mr. <i>Townley</i> by <i>Weltdon</i>, and said to
be finished by himself, is in the possession of Mr.
<i>James Townley</i>, proctor in <i>Doctors Commons</i>. A mezzotinto
print from it will be mentioned under the
year 1781 in the <a href="#Page_409">Catalogue</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Edwards</i>, of <i>Beaufort Buildings</i>, has the portrait
of Sir <i>George Hay, The Savoyard Girl, The
Bench,</i> and <i>Mary Queen of Scots,</i><a name="FNanchor_76_96" id="FNanchor_76_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_96" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> by <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p>A conversation-piece by him is likewise at <i>Wanstead</i>
in <i>Essex</i>, the seat of Earl <i>Tylney</i>.<a name="FNanchor_77_97" id="FNanchor_77_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_97" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And Mrs.
<i>Hoadly</i> has a scene of <i>Ranger</i> and <i>Clarinda</i> in <i>The
Suspicious Husband</i>; and the late Chancellor <i>Hoadly</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
repeating a song to Dr. <i>Greene</i>, for him to compose;
both by <i>Hogarth</i>. The first of these is an indifferent
picture, and contains very inadequate likenesses of
the persons represented.</p>

<p>One of the best portraits <i>Hogarth</i> ever painted,
is at <i>Lichfield</i>. It is of a gentleman with whom
he was very intimate, and at whose houses at
<i>Mortlake</i> and in <i>Ironmongers-Lane</i> he spent much of
his time&mdash;Mr. <i>Joseph Porter</i>, of <i>London</i>, merchant,
who died <i>April</i> 7, 1749. Mrs. <i>Porter</i> the sister of this
gentleman (who was daughter of Dr. <i>Johnson's</i> wife
by a former husband) is in possession of the picture.&mdash;<i>John
Steers</i>, esq. (of <i>The Paper Buildings</i> in
<i>The Temple</i>) has an auction by <i>Hogarth</i>, in which Dr.
<i>Chauncey</i>, Dr. <i>Snagg</i>, and others, are introduced;
and the Earl of <i>Exeter</i> has a butcher's shop, with
<i>Slack</i> fighting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of <i>Hogarth's</i> lesser plates many were destroyed.
When he wanted a piece of copper on a sudden, he
would take any from which he had already worked
off such a number of impressions as he supposed he
should sell. He then sent it to be effaced, beat out,
or otherwise altered to his present purpose.</p>

<p>The plates which remained in his possession were
secured to Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i> by his will, dated <i>August</i> 12,
1764, chargeable with an annuity of 80 <i>l.</i> to his
sister <i>Anne</i>,<a name="FNanchor_78_98" id="FNanchor_78_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_98" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> who survived him. When, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
death of his other sister, she left off the business in
which she was engaged (see, in the Catalogue, the
first article among the "<a href="#Page_417">Prints of uncertain date</a>,")
he kindly took her home, and generously supported
her, making her, at the same time, useful in the
disposal of his prints. Want of tenderness and liberality
to his relations was not among the failings
of <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p>Of <i>Hogarth's</i> drawings and contributions towards
the works of others, perhaps a number, on enquiry,
might be found. An acquaintance of his, the late
worthy Mr. <i>John Sanderson</i>, architect, who repaired
<i>Woburn Abbey</i>, as well as <i>Bedford House</i> in <i>Bloomsbury-square</i>,
possessed several of his curiosities. One
was a sketch in black-lead of a celebrated young engraver
(long since dead) in a salivation. The best
that can be said of it is, that it was most disgustingly
natural. Even the coarse ornaments on the corners
of the blankets which enwrapped him, were characteristically
expressed. Our artist seems to have repeated
the same idea, though with less force, and
fewer adjuncts, in the third of his Election prints,
where a figure swaddled up in flannel is conveyed to
the hustings. Two other works, viz. a drawing in
<i>Indian</i> ink, and a painting in oil colours, exhibited
<i>Bedford House</i> in different points of view; the figures
only by <i>Hogarth</i>. Another represented the corner of
a street, with a man drinking under the spout of a
pump, and heartily angry with the water, which,
by issuing out too fast, and in too great quantities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
had deluged his face. Our great painter had obliged
Mr. <i>Sanderson</i> with several other comic sketches, &amp;c.
but most of them had been either begged or stolen,
before the communicator of these particulars became
acquainted with him.</p>

<p>In the year 1745, <i>Launcelot Burton</i> was appointed
naval officer at <i>Deal. Hogarth</i> had seen him
by accident; and on a piece of paper, previously
impressed by a plain copper-plate, drew his figure
with a pen, in imitation of a coarse etching. He was
represented on a lean <i>Canterbury</i> hack, with a bottle
sticking out of his pocket; and underneath was an
inscription, intimating that he was going down to
take possession of his place. This was inclosed to
him in a letter; and some of his friends, who were in
the secret, protested the drawing to be a print which
they had seen exposed to sale at the shops in <i>London</i>;
a circumstance that put him in a violent passion, during
which he wrote an abusive letter to <i>Hogarth</i>,
whose name was subscribed to the work. But, after
poor <i>Burton's</i> tormentors had kept him in suspence
throughout an uneasy three weeks, they proved to
him that it was no engraving, but a sketch with a
pen and ink. He then became so perfectly reconciled
to his resemblance, that he shewed it with exultation
to Admiral <i>Vernon</i>, and all the rest of his
friends.</p>

<p>In 1753, <i>Hogarth</i> returning with Dr. <i>Morell</i> from
a visit to Mr. <i>Rich</i> at <i>Cowley</i>, stopped his chariot, and
got out, being struck by a large drawing (with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
coal) on the wall of an alehouse. He immediately
made a sketch of it with triumph; it was a St.
<i>George and the Dragon</i>, all in strait lines.</p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> made one essay in sculpture. He wanted
a sign to distinguish his house in <i>Leicester-fields</i>; and
thinking none more proper than the <i>Golden Head</i>,
he, out of a mass of cork made up of several thicknesses
compacted together, carved a bust of <i>Vandyck</i>,
which he gilt and placed over his door. It is long
since decayed, and was succeeded by a head in
plaster, which has also perished; and is supplied
by a head of Sir <i>Isaac Newton. Hogarth</i> modelled
another resemblance of <i>Vandyck</i> in clay; which is
likewise destroyed.</p>

<p>It is very properly observed by Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, that
"If ever an author wanted a commentary, that none
of his beauties might be lost, it is <i>Hogarth</i>; not
from being obscure (for he never was that but in
two or three of his first prints, where transient national
follies, as Lotteries, Free-masonry, and the
<i>South Sea</i>, were his topics) but for the use of foreigners,
and from a multiplicity of little incidents,
not essential to, but always heightening the
principal action. Such is the spider's web extended
over the poor's box in a parish church;
the blunders in architecture in the nobleman's seat,
seen through the window, in the first print of
<i>Marriage à la Mode</i>; and a thousand in the Strollers
dressing in a barn, which, for wit and imagination,
without any other aid, is perhaps the best of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
his works; as, for useful and deep satire, that on
the Methodists is the most sublime. <i>Rouquet</i>, the
enameller, published a <i>French</i> explanation, though
a superficial one, of many of his prints, which,
it was said, he had drawn up for the use of Marshal
<i>Belleisle</i>, then a prisoner in <i>England</i>."</p>

<p>However great the deficiencies in this work may
be, it was certainly suggested by <i>Hogarth</i>, and
drawn up at his immediate request. I receive this
information from undoubted authority. Some of
the circumstances explanatory of the plates, he communicated;
the rest he left to be supplied by <i>Rouquet</i>
his near neighbour, who lived in the house at which
<i>Gardelle</i> the enameller afterwards lodged, and murdered
his landlady Mrs. <i>King. Rouquet</i>, who (as I
learn from Mr. <i>Walpole</i>) was a <i>Swiss</i> of <i>French</i> extraction,
had formerly published a small tract on the
state of the Arts in <i>England</i>, and another, intituled
"L'Art de peinture en fromage ou en ramequin, 1755;"
12mo. (V. "La <i>France</i> litteraire, ou Dictionaire des
Auteurs <i>François</i> vivans, par <i>M. Formey</i>, 1757.") On
the present occasion he was liberally paid by <i>Hogarth</i>,
for having cloathed his sentiments and illustrations in
a foreign dress. This pamphlet was designed, and
continues to be employed, as a constant companion to
all such sets of his prints as go abroad. Only the letter
descriptive of the <i>March to Finchley</i> was particularly
meant for the instruction of Marshal <i>Belleisle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_79_99" id="FNanchor_79_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_99" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>It was added after the three former epistles had been
printed off, and before the plate was published. The
entire performance, however, in my opinion, exhibits
very strong marks of the vivacious compiler's
taste, country, and prejudices. Indeed many passages
must have been inserted without the privity of
his employer, who had no skill in the <i>French</i> language.
That our <i>clergy</i> always <i>affect to ride on white
horses</i>, and other remarks of a similar turn, &amp;c. &amp;c.
could never have fallen from the pen of <i>Hogarth</i>, or
any other <i>Englishman</i>.</p>

<p>This epistle bears also internal evidence to the
suggestions <i>Rouquet</i> received from <i>Hogarth</i>. Are not
the self-congratulations and prejudices of our artist
sufficiently visible in the following passage?</p>

<p>"Ce Tableau dis-je a le defaut d'etre encore tout
brillant de cette ignoble fraîcheur qu'on decouvre
dans la nature, et <i>qu'on ne voit jamais dans les cabinets
bien célèbres. Le tems ne l'a point encore obscurci de cette
decte fumée, de ce usage sacré, qui le
cachera quelque jour aux yeux profanes du vulgaire,
pour ne laisser voir ses beautés qu'aux initiés.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The title of this performance, is, "Lettres de
Monsieur * * à un de ses Amis à <i>Paris</i>, pour lui
expliquer les Estampes de Monsieur <i>Hogarth</i>.&mdash;Imprimé
à <i>Londres</i>: et se vend chez <i>R. Dodsley</i>,
dans <i>Pall Mall</i>; et chez <i>M. Cooper</i>, dans <i>Paternoster
Row</i>, 1746." (Le prix est de douze sols.)</p>

<p>I should here observe, that this pamphlet affords
only descriptions of the <i>Harlot's</i> and <i>Rake's Progress,
Marriage à la Mode,</i> and the <i>March to Finchley</i>. Nine
other plates, viz. the <i>Modern Midnight Conversation</i>,
the <i>Distressed Poet</i>, the <i>Enraged Musician,</i> the <i>Fair,
Strolling Actresses dressing in a Barn,</i> and the <i>Four
Times of the Day,</i> are enumerated without particular
explanation.</p>

<p>I am authorized to add, that <i>Hogarth</i>, not long
before his death, had determined, in compliance
with the repeated solicitations of his customers, to
have this work enlarged and rendered into <i>English</i>,
with the addition of ample comments on all his performances
undescribed by <i>Rouquet</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Hogarth</i> Moralised"<a name="FNanchor_80_100" id="FNanchor_80_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_100" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> will however in some small
degree (a very small one) contribute to preserve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
memory of those temporary circumstances which Mr.
<i>Walpole</i> is so justly apprehensive will be lost to posterity.
Such an undertaking indeed, requires a more
intimate acquaintance with fleeting customs, and past
occurrences, than the compiler of this work can
pretend to. Yet enough has been done by him to
awaken a spirit of enquiry, and point out the means
by which it may be farther gratified.</p>

<p>The works of <i>Hogarth</i>, as his elegant biographer
has well observed, are his history;<a name="FNanchor_81_101" id="FNanchor_81_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_101" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and the curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
are highly indebted to Mr. <i>Walpole</i> for a catalogue
of prints, drawn up from his own valuable collection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
in 1771. But as neither that catalogue, nor his appendix
to it in 1780, have given the whole of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
<i>Hogarth's</i> labours, I hope that I shall not be blamed
if, by including Mr. <i>Walpole's</i> catalogue, I have endeavoured
from later discoveries of our artist's prints
in other collections, to arrange them in chronological
order. It may not be unamusing to trace the rise
and progress of a Genius so strikingly original.</p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> gave first impressions of all his plates to
his late friends the Rev. Mr. <i>Townley</i> and Dr. <i>Isaac
Schomberg</i>.<a name="FNanchor_82_102" id="FNanchor_82_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_102" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Both sets were sold since the death of
these gentlemen. That which was Dr. <i>Schomberg's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
became the property of the late Sir <i>John Chapman</i>, baronet;
and passed after his death into the hands of his
brother, the late Sir <i>William Chapman</i>. I should add,
indeed, that our artist never sorted his impressions,
selecting the slight from the strong ones: so that
they who wish to possess any equal series of his
prints, must pick it out of different sets.</p>

<p>A portrait of <i>Samuel Martin</i>, esq. the antagonist of
Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>, which Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> had painted for his
own use, he gave as a legacy to Mr. <i>Martin</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Baynes</i>, of <i>Kneeton-Hall</i>, near <i>Richmond, Yorkshire,</i>
has an original picture by <i>Hogarth</i>, four feet
two inches long, by two feet four inches wide. It is
a landscape, with several figures; a man driving
sheep; a boat upon a piece of water, and a distant
view of a town. This picture was bought in <i>London</i>,
by her father, many years ago.</p>

<p>At Lord <i>Essex's</i> sale, in <i>January</i> 1777, Mr. <i>Garrick</i>
bought a picture by <i>Hogarth</i>, being the examination
of the recruits before the justices <i>Shallow</i> and <i>Silence</i>.
For this, it was said in the news-papers, he gave 350
guineas. I have since been told, that remove the
figure 3, and the true price paid by the purchaser
remains. In private he allowed that he never gave
the former of these sums, though in the public
prints he did not think such a confession necessary.
It was in reality an indifferent performance, as those
of <i>Hogarth</i> commonly were, when he strove to paint
up to the ideas of others.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Browning</i>, of <i>King's College, Cambridge,</i> has a
small picture by <i>Hogarth</i>, representing <i>Clare-Market</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
It seems to have been one of our artist's early performances.</p>

<p>There are three large pictures by <i>Hogarth</i>, over
the altar in the church of <i>St. Mary Redcliff</i> at <i>Bristol</i>;
the sealing of the sacred Sepulchre, the Ascension,
and the three <i>Maries</i>, &amp;c. A sum of money was
left to defray the expence of these ornaments, and
it found its way into <i>Hogarth's</i> pocket. The original
sketches in oil for these performances, are now at
Mrs. <i>Hogarth's</i> house in <i>Leicester-fields</i>.</p>

<p>In Lord <i>Grosvenor's</i> house, at <i>Milbank, Westminster</i>,
is a small painting by our artist on the following
subject. A boy's paper-kite in falling become entangled
with furze: the boy arrives just as a crow is
tearing it in pieces. The expression in his face is
worthy of <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> was also supposed to have had some hand
in the exhibition of signs,<a name="FNanchor_83_103" id="FNanchor_83_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_103" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> projected above 20 years
ago by <i>Bonnel Thornton</i>, of festive memory; but I
am informed, that he contributed no otherwise towards
this display, than by a few touches of chalk.
Among the heads of distinguished personages, finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
those of the King of <i>Prussia</i> and the Empress of
<i>Hungary</i>, he changed the cast of their eyes so as to
make them leer significantly at each other. This is
related on the authority of Mr. <i>Colman</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Richardson</i> ("now," as Dr. <i>Johnson</i> says,
"better known by his books than his pictures,"
though his colouring is allowed to be masterly) having
accounted for some classical quotations in his
notes on <i>Milton</i>, unlearned as he was, by his son's
assisting him as a telescope does the eye in astronomy;
<i>Hogarth</i> shewed him with a telescope looking
through his son (in no very decent attitude) at a
<i>Virgil</i> aloft on a shelf; but afterwards destroyed the
plate, and recalled the prints. Qu. if any remain, and
what date?&mdash;I much question whether this subject was
ever thrown upon copper, or meant for the public eye.</p>

<p>In the "Nouveau Dictionnaire Historique, <i>Caen</i>,
1783," our artist is thus characterized: "Ses
compositions sont mal dessinées &amp; foiblement colories;
mais ce sont des tableaux parlans de diverses
scènes comiques ou morales de la vie. Il avoit
négligé le méchanisme de son art, c'est à-dire, les
traits du pinceau, le rapport des parties entr'elles,
l'effèt du clare obscure, l'harmonie du coloris, &amp;c.
pour s'élever jusqu'à la perfection de ce méchanisme,
c'est à-dire, au poétique &amp; au moral de la
peinture. 'Je reconnois,' disoit-il, 'tout le monde
pour juge compétent de mes tableaux, excepté les
connoisseurs de profession.' Un seul exemple prouvera
combien réussit. Il avoit fait graver une<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
estampe, dans laquelle il avoit exprimé avec
énergie les différens tourmens qu'on fait éprouver
aux animaux. Un charrier fouettoit un jour ses
chevaux avec beaucoup de dureté; un bon homme,
touché de pitié, lui dit, 'Miserable! tu n'as donc
pas vu l'estampe d'<i>Hogarth</i>?' Il n'étoit pas seulement
peintre, il fut écrivain. Il publia en 1750
un traité en <i>Anglois</i>, intitulé, '<i>Analyse de la Beauté</i>.'
L'auteur pretend que les formes arrondies constituent
la beauté du corps: principe vrai à certains
égards, faux a plusieurs autres. <i>Voy.</i> sur cet artiste,
la sécond volume du 'Mercure de France,'
Janvier, 1770."</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Peter Dupont</i>, a merchant, had the drawing
of <i>Paul before Felix</i>, which he purchased for 20 guineas,
and bound up with a set of <i>Hogarth's</i> prints.
The whole set was afterwards sold by auction, at
<i>Baker's</i>, for 17 <i>l.</i> to Mr. <i>Ballard</i> of <i>Little Britain</i>, in
whose catalogue it stood some time marked at 25 <i>l.</i>
and was parted with for less than that sum.</p>

<p>The following original drawings, by <i>Hogarth</i>, are
now in the collection of the Rev. Dr. <i>Lort</i>:</p>

<p>A coloured sketch of a Family Picture, with ten
whole-length figures, most insipidly employed. A
Head of a Sleeping Child, in colours, as large as
life, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>When <i>Hogarth</i> designed the print intituled <i>Morning</i>,
his idea of an <i>Old Maid</i> appears to have been adopted
from one of that forlorn sisterhood, when emaciated
by corroding appetites, or, to borrow <i>Dryden's</i> more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
forcible language, by "agony of unaccomplished
love." But there is in being, and perhaps in <i>Leicester-fields</i>,
a second portrait by our artist, exhibiting the
influence of the same misfortune on a more fleshy
carcase. The ancient virgin<a name="FNanchor_84_104" id="FNanchor_84_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_104" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> now treated of, is
corpulent even to shapelessness. Her neck resembles
a collar of brawn; and had her arms been admitted
on the canvas, they must have rivalled in magnitude
the thighs of the <i>Farnesian</i> god. Her bosom,
luckily for the spectator, is covered; as a display of
it would have served only to provoke abhorrence.
But what words can paint the excess of malice and
vulgarity predominant in her visage!&mdash;an inflated
hide that seems bursting with venom&mdash;a brow
wrinkled by a <i>Sardonic</i> grin that threatens all the
vengeance an affronted Fury would rejoice to execute.
Such ideas also of warmth does this mountain
of quaggy flesh communicate, that, without
hyperbole, one might swear she would parch the
earth she trod on, thaw a frozen post-boy, or over-heat
a glasshouse. "How dreadful," said a bystander,
"would be this creature's hatred!" "How
much more formidable," replied his companion,
"would be her love!"&mdash;Such, however, was the
skill of <i>Hogarth</i>, that he could impress similar indications
of stale virginity on features directly contrasted,
and force us to acknowledge one identical
character in the brim-full and exhausted representative
of involuntary female celibacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i> has likewise a sketch in chalk, on
blue paper, of <i>Falstaff</i> and his companions; two
sketches intended for the "Happy Marriage;" a
sketch for a picture to shew the pernicious effects of
masquerading; sketch of King <i>George</i> II. and the
royal family; sketch of his present Majesty, taken
hastily on seeing the new coinage of 1764; portrait
of <i>Hogarth</i> by himself, with a palette; of Justice
<i>Welsh</i>;<a name="FNanchor_85_105" id="FNanchor_85_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_105" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> of Sir <i>James Thornhill</i>; of Sir <i>Edward
Walpole</i>;<a name="FNanchor_86_106" id="FNanchor_86_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_106" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> of his friend <i>George Lambert</i>, the landscape-painter;
of a boy; of a girl's head, in the
character of <i>Diana</i>, finished according to <i>Hogarth's</i>
idea of beauty; of a black girl; and of Governor
<i>Rogers</i> and his family, a conversation-piece; eleven
Sketches from Nature, designed for Mr. <i>Lambert</i>;
four drawings of conversations at <i>Button's Coffee-house</i>;
<i>Cymon</i> and <i>Iphigenia</i>; two black chalk drawings
(landscapes) given to Mr. <i>Kirby</i> in 1762; three
heads, slightly drawn with a pen by <i>Hogarth</i>, to exemplify
his distinction between <i>Character</i> and <i>Caricature</i>,
done at the desire of Mr. <i>Townley</i>, whose son
gave them to Dr. <i>Schomberg</i>; a landscape in oil:
with several other sketches in oil.</p>

<p>The late Mr. <i>Forrest</i>, of <i>York Buildings</i>, was in
possession of a sketch in oil of our Saviour (designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
as a pattern for painted glass), together with the
original portrait of <i>Tibson</i> the Laceman,<a name="FNanchor_87_107" id="FNanchor_87_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_107" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and several
drawings descriptive of the incidents that happened
during a five days tour by land and water. The
parties were Messieurs <i>Hogarth, Thornhill</i> (son of the
late Sir <i>James</i>), <i>Scott</i> (the ingenious landscape-painter
of that name), <i>Tothall</i>,<a name="FNanchor_88_108" id="FNanchor_88_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_108" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and <i>Forrest</i>. They set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
at midnight, at a moment's warning, from the <i>Bedford
Arms</i> Tavern, with each a shirt in his pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
They had particular departments to attend to; <i>Hogarth</i>
and <i>Scott</i> made the drawings; <i>Thornhill</i> the
map; <i>Tothall</i> faithfully discharged the joint office of
treasurer and caterer; and <i>Forrest</i> wrote the journal.
They were out five days only; and on the second
night after their return, the book was produced,
bound, gilt, and lettered, and read at the same tavern
to the members of the club then present. Mr.
<i>Forrest</i> had also drawings of two of the members
(<i>Gabriel Hunt</i> and <i>Ben Read</i>), remarkable fat men,
in ludicrous situations. Etchings from all these having
been made in 1782, accompanied by the original
journal in letter-press, an account of them will appear
in the Catalogue under that year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>A transcript of the journal was left in the hands of
Mr. <i>Gostling</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_109" id="FNanchor_89_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_109" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> who wrote an imitation of it in <i>Hudibrastic</i>
verse; <span class="smcap">twenty copies</span> only of which having been
printed in 1781, as a literary curiosity,<a name="FNanchor_90_110" id="FNanchor_90_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_110" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> I was requested
by some of my friends to reprint it at the
end of the second edition of this work. It had originally
been kept back, in compliment to the writer
of the prose journey; but, as that in the mean time
had been given to the public by authority, to preserve
the Tour in a more agreeable dress cannot, it
is presumed, be deemed an impropriety. See the

<p><a name="Footnote_2_13" id="Footnote_2_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_13"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> "I must leave you to the annals of Fame," says Mr.
<i>Walker</i>, the ingenious Lecturer on Natural Philosophy, who
favoured me with these particulars, "for the rest of the
anecdotes of this great Genius; and shall endeavour to
shew you, that his family possessed similar talents, but they
were destined, like the wild rose,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"'To waste their sweetness in the desart air.'<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
"Happy should I be to rescue from oblivion the name of <i>Ald
Hogart</i>, whose songs and quibbles have so often delighted
my childhood! These simple strains of this mountain <i>Theocritus</i>
were fabricated while he held the plough, or was
leading his fewel from the hills. He was as critical an observer
of nature as his nephew, for the narrow field he had
to view her in: not an incident or an absurdity in the neighbourhood
escaped him. If any one was hardy enough to
break through any decorum of old and established repute;
if any one attempted to over-reach his neighbour, or cast a
leering eye at his wife; he was sure to hear himself sung
over the whole parish, nay, to the very boundaries of the
<i>Westmoreland</i> dialect: so that his songs were said to have a
greater effect on the manners of his neighbourhood, than
even the sermons of the parson himself.
</p>
<p>
"But his poetical talents were not confined to the incidents
of his village. I myself have had the honour to bear a
part in one of his plays (I say <i>one</i>, for there are several of
them extant in MS. in the mountains of <i>Westmoreland</i> at this
hour). This play was called 'The Destruction of <i>Troy</i>.'
It was written in metre, much in the manner of <i>Lopez de
Vega</i>, or the ancient <i>French</i> drama; the unities were not
too strictly observed, for the siege of ten years was all represented;
every hero was in the piece; so that the Dramatis
Personæ consisted of every lad of genius in the whole
parish. The wooden horse&mdash;<i>Hector</i> dragged by the heels&mdash;the
fury of <i>Diomed</i>&mdash;the flight of <i>Æneas</i>&mdash;and the burning
of the city, were all represented. I remember not what
Fairies had to do in all this; but as I happened to be about
three feet high at the time of this still-talked-of exhibition,
I personated one of these tiny beings. The stage was a fabrication
of boards placed about six feet high, on strong
posts; the green-room was partitioned off with the same
materials; it's cieling was the azure canopy of heaven;
and the boxes, pit, and galleries, were laid into one by the
Great Author of Nature, for they were the green slope of
a fine hill. Despise not, reader, this humble state of the
provincial drama; let me tell you, there were more spectators,
for three days together, than your three theatres in
<i>London</i> would hold; and let me add, still more to your
confusion, that you never saw an audience half so well
pleased.
</p>
<p>
"The exhibition was begun with a grand procession, from
the village to a great stone (dropt by the Devil about a
quarter of a mile off, when he tried in vain to erect a
bridge across <i>Windermere</i>; so the people, unlike the rest of
the world, have remained a very good sort of people ever
since). I say the procession was begun by the minstrels of
five parishes, and were followed by a yeoman on bull-back&mdash;you
stare!&mdash;stop then till I inform you that this adept
had so far civilised his bull, that he would suffer the yeoman
to mount his back, and even to play upon his fiddle there.
The managers besought him to join the procession; but the
bull, not being accustomed to much company, and particularly
so much applause; whether he was intoxicated with
praise; thought himself affronted, and made game of; or
whether a favourite cow came across his imagination; certain
it was, that he broke out of the procession; erected his
tail, and, like another <i>Europa</i>, carried off the affrighted
yeoman and his fiddle, over hedge and ditch, till he arrived
at his own field. This accident rather inflamed than depressed
the good humour arising from the procession; and
the clown, or jack-pudding of the piece, availed himself
so well of the incident, that the lungs and ribs of the spectators
were in manifest danger. This character was the
most important personage in the whole play: for his office
was to turn the most serious parts of the drama into burlesque
and ridicule: he was a compound of Harlequin and
the Merry Andrew, or rather the Arch-fool of our ancient
kings. His dress was a white jacket, covered with bulls,
bears, birds, fish, &amp;c. cut in various coloured cloth. His
trowsers were decorated in like manner, and hung round
with small bells; and his cap was that of Folly, decorated
with bells, and an otter's brush impending. The lath sword
must be of great antiquity in this island, for it has been
the appendage of a jack-pudding in the mountains of <i>Westmoreland</i>
time out of mind.
</p>
<p>
"The play was opened by this character with a song,
which answered the double purpose of a play-bill and a
a prologue, for his ditty gave the audience a foretaste of the
rueful incidents they were about to behold; and it called
out the actors, one by one, to make the spectators acquainted
with their names and characters, walking round
and round till the whole Dramatis Personæ made one great
circle on the stage. The audience being thus become acquainted
with the actors, the play opened with <i>Paris</i> running
away with <i>Helen</i>, and <i>Menelaus</i> scampering after them;
then followed the death of <i>Patroclus</i>, the rage of <i>Achilles</i>,
the persuasions of <i>Ulysses</i>,&amp;c. &amp;c. and the whole interlarded
with apt songs, both serious and comic, all the production
of <i>Ald Hogart</i>. The bard, however, at this time had been
dead some years, and I believe this Fete was a Jubilee to
his memory; but let it not detract from the invention of
Mr. <i>Garrick</i>, to say that his at <i>Stratford</i> was but a copy of
one forty years ago on the banks of <i>Windermere</i>. Was it
any improvement, think you, to introduce several <i>bulls</i> into
the procession instead of one? But I love not comparisons,
and so conclude. Yours, &amp;c. <span class="smcap">Adam Walker</span>."
</p>
<p>
However <i>Ald Hogart</i> might have succeeded in the dramatic
line, and before a rustic audience, his poems of a different
form are every way contemptible. Want of grammar, metre,
sense, and decency, are their invariable characteristics. This
opinion is founded on a thorough examination of a whole
bundle of them, transmitted by a friend since the first publication
of this work.</p></div>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
Nor was <i>Savage</i> less severe in his prose. On the trial of
this unfortunate poet, for the murder of <i>James Sinclair</i> in
1727, Judge <i>Page</i>, who was then on the bench, treated him
with his usual insolence and severity; and, when he had
summed up the evidence, endeavoured to exasperate the jury,
as Mr. <i>Savage</i> used to relate it, with this eloquent harangue:
"Gentlemen of the Jury, you are to consider that Mr. <i>Savage</i>
is a very great man, a much greater man than you or I,
gentlemen of the jury; that he wears very fine cloaths,
much finer cloaths than you or I, gentlemen of the jury;
that he has abundance of money in his pocket, much more
money than you or I, gentlemen of the jury: but, gentlemen
of the jury, is it not a very hard case, gentlemen of
the jury, that Mr. <i>Savage</i> should therefore kill you or me,
gentlemen of the jury?"
</p>
<p>
<i>Pope</i> also, <i>Horace</i>, B. II. Sat. r, has the following line:
</p>
<blockquote><p>"Hard words or hanging, if your judge be <i>Page.</i>"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And <i>Fielding</i>, in <i>Tom Jones</i>, makes <i>Partridge</i> say, with great
<i>naiveté</i>, after premising that judge <i>Page</i> was a very brave man,
and a man of great wit, "It is indeed charming sport to hear
trials on life and death!"</p>

<span class="smcap">William Hogarth</span>, Plaintiff.

<p>
<i>Middlesex.</i>
</p>
<p>
The Plaintiff declares, that on the 20th of <i>December</i>,
1727, at <i>Westminster</i> aforesaid, Defendant was indebted
to him 30 <i>l</i>. for painter's work, and for divers materials
laid out for the said work; which Defendant faithfully
promised to pay when demanded.
</p>
<p>
Plaintiff also declares, that Defendant promised to pay for the
said work and other materials, as much as the same was worth;
and Plaintiff in fact says the same was worth other 30 <i>l</i>.
</p>
<p>
Plaintiff also declares for another sum of 30 <i>l</i> for money
laid out and expended for Defendant's use, which he promised
to pay.
</p>
<p>
The said Defendant not performing his several promises, the
Plaintiff hath brought this action to his damage 30 <i>l</i>. for which
this action is brought.
</p>
<p>
To which the Defendant hath pleaded <i>non assumpsit</i> and
thereupon issue is joined.
</p>
<p>
CASE.
</p>
<p>
The Defendant is an upholsterer and tapestry-worker, and
was recommended to Plaintiff as a person skilful in painting
patterns for that purpose; the Plaintiff accordingly came to
Defendant, who informing him that he had occasion for a tapestry
design of the Element of Earth, to be painted on canvas,
Plaintiff told Defendant he was well skilled in painting
that way, and promised to perform it in a workmanlike manner;
which if he did, Defendant undertook to pay him for it
twenty guineas.
</p>
<p>
Defendant, soon after, hearing that Plaintiff was an engraver,
and no painter, was very uneasy about the work, and ordered
his servant to go and acquaint Plaintiff what he had heard;
and Plaintiff then told the said servant, 'that it was a bold
undertaking, for that he never did any thing of that kind
before; and that, if his master did not like it, he should not
pay for it.'
</p>
<p>
That several times sending after Plaintiff to bring the same
to Defendant's house, he did not think fit so to do; but carried
the same to a private place where Defendant keeps some
people at work, and there left it. As soon as Defendant was
informed of it, he sent for it home, and consulted with his
workmen whether the design was so painted as they could
work tapestry by it, and they were all unanimous that it was
not finished in a workmanlike manner, and that it was impossible
for them to work tapestry by it.
</p>
<p>
Upon this, Defendant sent the painting back to Plaintiff by
his servant, who acquainted him, 'that the same did not answer
the Defendant's purpose, and that it was of no use to him;
but if he would finish it in a proper manner, Defendant would
take it, and pay for it.'
</p>
<p>
Defendant employs some of the finest hands in <i>Europe</i> in
working tapestry, who are most of them foreigners, and have
worked abroad as well as here, and are perfect judges of performances
of this kind.
</p>
<p>
The Plaintiff undertook to finish said piece in a month, but
it was near three months before he sent to the Defendant to
view it; who, when he saw it, told him that he could not make
any use of it, and was so disappointed for want of it, that he
was forced to put his workmen upon working other tapestry
that was not bespoke, to the value of 200 <i>l.</i> which now lies
by him, and another painter is now painting another proper
pattern for the said piece of tapestry.
</p>
<p>
To prove the case as above set forth, call Mr. <i>William Bradshaw</i>.
</p>
<p>
To prove the painting not to be performed in a workmanlike
manner, and that it was impossible to make tapestry by it,
and that it was of no use to Plaintiff, call Mr. <i>Bernard Dorrider</i>,
Mr. <i>Phillips</i>, Mr. <i>De Friend</i>, Mr. <i>Danten</i>, and Mr. <i>Pajon</i>.
</p>
<p>
By the counsel's memoranda on this brief it appears, that
the witnesses examined for the Plaintiff were <i>Thomas King, Vanderbank,
Le Gard, Thornhill,</i> and <i>Cullumpton</i>.</p></div>

to King <i>George</i> I. In <i>June</i> 1715, he agreed to paint the cupola
of <i>St. Paul's</i> church for 4000 <i>l.</i> and was knighted in <i>April</i> 1720.
In a flattering account given of him immediately after his death,
which happened <i>May</i> 13, 1734, in his 57th year, he is said to
have been "the greatest history-painter this kingdom ever
produced, witness his elaborate works in <i>Greenwich-Hospital</i>,
the cupola of <i>St. Paul's</i>, the altar-pieces of <i>All-Souls College</i>
in <i>Oxford</i>, and in the church of <i>Weymouth</i>, where he was
born; a cieling in the palace of <i>Hampton-Court</i>, by order of
the late Earl of <i>Halifax:</i> his other works shine in divers
noblemens' and gentlemens' houses. His later years were
employed in copying the rich cartoons of <i>Raphael</i> in the
gallery of <i>Hampton-Court</i>, which, though in decay, will be
revived by his curious pencil, not only in their full proportions,
but in many other sizes and shapes, he in a course of
years had drawn them. He was chosen representative in
the two last parliaments for <i>Weymouth</i>, and having, by his
own industry, acquired a considerable estate, re-purchased
the seat of his ancestors, which he re-edified and embellished.
He was not only by patents appointed history-painter to
their late and present majesties, but serjeant-painter, by
which he was to paint all the royal palaces, coaches, barges,
and the royal navy. This late patent he surrendered in favour
of his only son <i>John Thornhill</i>, Esq. He left no other
issue but one daughter, now the wife of Mr <i>Wm. Hogarth</i>,
admired for his curious miniature conversation paintings.

which he very particularly and severely criticises the house,
the furniture, the gardens, and the entertainments of <i>Timon</i>,
a man of great wealth and little taste. By <i>Timon</i> he was
universally supposed, and by the Earl of <i>Burlington</i>, to
whom the poem is addressed, was privately said to mean
the Duke of <i>Chandos</i>; a man perhaps too much delighted
with pomp and shew, but of a temper kind and beneficent,
and who had consequently the voice of the publick in his
favour. A violent outcry was therefore raised against the
ingratitude and treachery of <i>Pope</i>, who was said to have
been indebted to the patronage of <i>Chandos</i> for a present of
a thousand pounds, and who gained the opportunity of
insulting him by the kindness of his invitation. The receipt
of the thousand pounds <i>Pope</i> publickly denied; but from the
reproach which the attack on a character so amiable brought
upon him, he tried all means of escaping. The name of
<i>Cleland</i> was employed in an apology, by which no man was
satisfied; and he was at last reduced to shelter his temerity
behind dissimulation, and endeavour to make that disbelieved
which he never had confidence openly to deny. He wrote
an exculpatory letter to the Duke, which was answered
with great magnanimity, as by a man who accepted his
excuse without believing his professions. He said, that to
have ridiculed his taste, or his buildings, had been an indifferent
action in another man; but that in <i>Pope</i>, after the
reciprocal kindness that had been exchanged between them,
it had been less easily excused." <i>Dr. Johnson, in his Life of

became a commoner of <i>Trinity College, Oxford</i>,
was ordained deacon, lived gaily, and died young. His style,
however, appears to have been formed on a general acquaintance
with the language of <i>Roman</i> poetry; nor do any of his
effusions betray that poverty of expression so conspicuous in
the poems of <i>Nicholas Hardinge</i>, esq. who writes as if <i>Horace</i>

Thus, between the poet and the painter, the fame of our
harlot-hunting Justice is preserved. But as a slave anciently
rode in the same chariot with the conqueror, the memory of
a celebrated street-robber and highwayman will descend with
that of the magistrate to posterity, <i>James Dalton's</i> wig-box
being placed on the tester of the Harlot's bed. I learn from
the <i>Grubstreet Journal</i>, that he was executed on the 12th of
<i>May</i>, 1730. Sir <i>John Gonson</i> died <i>January</i> 9, 1765. He was
remarkable for the charges which he used to deliver to the
grand juries, which are said to have been written by Orator
<i>Henley</i>. The following puffs, or sneers, concerning them,
are found in the first number of the <i>Grubstreet Journal</i>, dated
<i>January</i> 8, 1730. "Yesterday began the General Quarter
Sessions, &amp;c. when Sir <i>John Gonson</i>, being in the chair, gave
a most <i>incomparable, learned,</i> and <i>fine</i> charge to the Grand
Jury." <i>Daily Post</i>.
</p>
<p>
"The <i>Morning Post</i> calls Sir <i>John's</i> charge <i>excellent, learned</i>
and <i>loyal</i>. The <i>Evening Post</i> calls it an <i>excellent lecture</i> and
<i>useful charge</i>."
</p>
<p>
Three of these performances had been published in 1728.<a name="FNanchor_B_46" id="FNanchor_B_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_46" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>

on delivering his opinion in the court of session upon the question
of literary property, in the cause of <i>Hinton</i> and <i>Donaldson</i>
and others, all booksellers, in <i>July</i> 1773 thus introduced the
works of <i>Hogarth</i>: "There is nothing can be more similar
than the work of engraving is to literary composition. I
will illustrate this proposition by the works of Mr <i>Hogarth</i>,
who, in my humble opinion, is the only true original artist
which this age has produced in <i>England</i>. There is hardly
any character of an excellent author, which is not justly applicable
to his works. What composition, what variety,
what sentiment, what fancy, invention, and humour, we
discover in all his performances! In every one of them an
entertaining history, a natural description of characters, and
an excellent moral. I can read his works over and over,
<i>Horace's</i> characteristic of excellency in writing, <i>decies repetita
placebit</i>; and every time I peruse them, I discover new
beauties, and feel fresh entertainment: can I say more in
commendation of the literary compositions of a <i>Butler</i> or a
<i>Swift</i>? There is great authority for this parallel; the legislature
has considered the works of authors and engravers
in the same light; they have granted the same protection to
both; and it is remarkable, that the act of parliament for the
protection of those who invent new engravings, or prints,
is almost in the same words with the act for the protection
and encouragement of literary compositions." This is taken
from a 4to pamphlet, published in 1774 by <i>James Boswell</i>, esq.
advocate, one of the counsel in the cause.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37_55" id="Footnote_37_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_55"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> "That <i>Huggins</i> penned the statute, I was told by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>
himself. The determination of Lord <i>Hardwicke</i> was
thus occasioned. <i>Jefferys</i>, the printseller at the corner of
<i>St. Martin's Lane</i>, had employed an artist to draw and engrave
a print representing the <i>British</i> Herring Fishery; and,
having paid him for it, took an assignment of the right to
the property in it accruing to the artist by the act of parliament.
The proprietors of one of the magazines pirated
it in a similar size, and <i>Jefferys</i> brought his bill for an injunction,
to which the defendants demurred: and, upon
argument of the demurrer, the same was allowed, for the
reason abovementioned, and the bill dismissed. <i>Hogarth</i>
attended the hearing; and lamented to me that he had employed
<i>Huggins</i> to draw the act, adding, that, when he first
projected it, he hoped it would be such an encouragement
to engraving and printselling, that printsellers would soon
become as numerous as bakers' shops; which hope, notwithstanding
the above check, does at this time seem to be
pretty nearly gratified." <i>For this note my readers are indebted
to Sir</i> John Hawkins.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_38_56" id="Footnote_38_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_56"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> "What Caricatura is in painting," says <i>Fielding</i>, "Burlesque
is in writing; and in the same manner the comic writer and
painter correlate to each other. And here I shall observe,
that as in the former the painter seems to have the advantage;
so it is in the latter infinitely on the side of the writer: for
the Monstrous is much easier to paint than describe, and the
Ridiculous to describe than paint. And though perhaps this
latter species doth not in either science so strongly affect and
agitate the muscles as the other; yet it will be owned, I believe,
that a more rational and useful pleasure arises to us
from it."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_57" id="Footnote_39_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_57"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> This idea originally occurred in <i>Colley Cibber's Apology</i>.
From thence it was transplanted by <i>Lloyd</i> into his celebrated
poem intituled <i>The Actor</i>. Lying thus in the way of <i>Garrick</i>,
he took it up for the use of the <i>prologue</i> already quoted.
Lastly, Mr. <i>Sheridan</i>, in his beautiful <i>Monody</i>, condescended to
borrow it, only because it spared him the labour of unlocking
the richer storehouse of his own imagination.
</p>
<p>
I may however remark that <i>Cibber</i>, when he suggested this
mortifying reflection, had more reason on his side than some
of his successors who have indulged themselves in the same dolorous
strain of complaint. To whatever oblivion the celebrated
actors of the last age have been resigned, the pencil of
<i>Hogarth, Dance, Zoffani,</i> and <i>Reynolds</i>, had left Mr. <i>Garrick</i>
not the slightest reason to be apprehensive that, in his own
particular case, the art and the artist would alike be forgotten.
Meanwhile, let our heroes of the stage be taught to moderate
their anxiety for posthumous renown, by a recollection that
their peculiar modes of excellence will, at least, be as well
preserved to futurity as those of the lords <i>Chatham</i> and <i>Mansfield</i>,
whose talents, perhaps, might support an equal claim to
perpetuation.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_40_58" id="Footnote_40_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_58"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Dr. <i>M.</i> once observed to <i>J. N.</i> in a letter on this subject,
"In the 13th chapter I was somewhat puzzled with the <i>flat</i>
and <i>round</i>, or the <i>concave</i> and <i>convex</i>, appearing the reverse;
till the sun happily shining in upon the cornice, I had a fair
example of what he intended to express. The next chapter,
with regard to <i>colouring</i>, did not go on quite so smooth;
for, if I satisfied <i>him</i>, I was not satisfied <i>myself</i> with his
peculiar principles; nor could I relish his laying the blame
on the <i>colourmen</i>, &amp;c."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41_59" id="Footnote_41_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_59"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> One exception to this remark occurs in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> for 1754, p. 14; where the reviewer of the Analysis
observes, that it is "a book written with that precision and
perspicuity which can only result from a perfect knowledge
of his subject in all its extent. His rules are illustrated by
near two hundred figures, engraved by himself; the knowledge
which it contains is universally useful, and as all terms
of art are avoided, the language will be universally understood.
The player and the dancing-master, whom others
consider as patterns of just action and genteel deportment,
are not less instructed than the statuary and the painter;
nor is there any species of beauty or elegance that is not
here investigated and analysed.
</p>
<p>
"A book, by which the author has discovered such superiority,
could scarce fail of creating many enemies; those
who admit his Analysis to be just, are disposed to deny that
it is new. Though in the year 1745, having drawn a serpentine
line on a painter's pallet, with these words under
it, 'the line of beauty,' as a frontispiece to his prints, no
<i>Egyptian</i> hieroglyphic ever produced greater variety of speculation;
both painters and sculptors then came to enquire
the meaning of a symbol, which they soon pretended to
have been their old acquaintance; though the account
they could give of its properties were scarce so satisfactory
as that of a day-labourer, who constantly uses the <i>lever</i>,
could give of that instrument, as a mechanical power. The
work, however, will live when these cavils are forgotten;
and except the originals, of which it is pretended to be a
copy, are produced, there is no question but that the name
of the author will descend to posterity with that honour
which competitors only can wish to withhold."
</p>
<p>
It should be observed, however, that the general decision on
<i>Hogarth's</i> performance may be just. Certain we are, that it
has not been reversed by the opinion of the First of our Modern
Painters.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_42_60" id="Footnote_42_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_60"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The <i>Analysis</i> itself however affords sufficient specimens of
inaccuracy in spelling. Thus we have (pref. p. xix.) <i>Syclamen</i>

(p. 65.) nuckles for <i>k</i>nuckles; (p. 97.) Iris<i>h</i>-stitch for Iris-stitch,

Warton</i> first made its appearance, <i>Hogarth</i> was highly delighted
with as much of it as he understood. But, not knowing
the import of the word ΗθΟΣ [Greek: Ethos], he hastened to his friends
for information. All, in their turn, sported with his want of
skill in the learned languages; first telling him it was Greek
for one strange thing, and then for another, so that his mind
remained in a state of suspence; as, for aught he knew to the
contrary, some such meaning might lie under these crooked
letters, as would overset the compliments paid him in the former
parts of the paragraph. No short time, therefore, had
passed before he could determine whether he ought to retract
or continue his charge against his adversary: but it was at last
obliterated. For several months afterwards, however, poor
<i>Hogarth</i> never praised his provision or his wine, without being
asked what proportion of the ΗθΟΣ [Greek: Ethos] he supposed to be in either.</p></div>

him by <i>Cæsar Hawkins</i> the surgeon; and, on the authority of
repeated inspection, I venture to affirm, that the fingers of
<i>Sigismunda</i> are unstained with blood, and that neither of her
hands is employed in rending ornaments from her head, or
any other part of her person. In this instance Mr. <i>Walpole's</i>
memory must have failed him, as I am confident that his misrepresentation
was undesigned. It is whispered (we know not
with how much truth) that Mrs. <i>H.</i> was hurt by this description
of the picture, and that she returned no thanks for the
volume that contains it, when it was sent to her as a present
by its author. It should seem that she still designs to dispose
of this ill-fated performance, and thinks that its reputation
required no additional blast.
</p>
<p>
I have reprinted this note, without correction, that I might
thereby obtain the fairer opportunity of doing justice to Mr.
<i>Walpole</i>, concerning the faithfulness of whose memory I had
ventured to express a doubt. Genuine information is not always
to be had; nor shall I hesitate a moment to apologize
for the fallaciousness of mine. The fingers of <i>Sigismunda</i> were
<i>originally</i> stained with blood. This indelicate and offensive circumstance
was pointed out by some intelligent friend to <i>Hogarth</i>,
who reluctantly effaced it.
</p>
<p>
A correspondent, however, on reading this work, has furnished
an additional reason why the lady already mentioned
may be offended by the severity of Mr. <i>Walpole's</i> strictures on
<i>Sigismunda</i>. "It has been whispered that Count <i>Guiscard's</i>
widow was a copy from the <i>daughter of Sir James Thornhill</i>.
If this circumstance be true, the very accomplished Critick
of <i>Strawberry Hill</i> will own at least that her wrath and <i>Juno's</i>
had the same provocation, '<i>Judiciam Paridis, spretæque
injuria formæ</i>.' Impartiality, however, obliges us to add,
that Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>, though in years, is still a very fine woman;
and that Mr. <i>Walpole's</i> idea of what a picture of <i>Sigismunda</i>
ought to express, is poetically conceived, and delivered
with uncommon elegance and force of language.
The <i>sober grief</i>, the <i>dignity of suppressed anguish</i>, the <i>involuntary
tear</i>, the <i>settled meditation on the fate she meant to meet</i>,
and the <i>amorous warmth turned holy by despair</i>, are words that
fill the place of colours, supply all the imperfections of
<i>Hogarth's</i> design, and succeed even where a <i>Furino</i> or a <i>Correggio</i>
may have failed."</p></div>

and fertile invention; and the last work, whatever it be, has necessarily
most of the grace of novelty. <i>Milton</i>, however it happened,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56_74" id="Footnote_56_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_74"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> <i>Sigismunda</i>, however, though she missed of judicious admirers,
had, at least, the good fortune to meet with a flatterer
in the late Mr. <i>Robert Lloyd</i>, whose poem intituled <i>Genius,
Envy,</i> and <i>Time,</i> addressed to <i>William Hogarth</i>, esq. has the
following lines. <i>Time</i> is the speaker.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"While <i>Sigismunda's</i> deep distress<br />
Which looks the soul of wretchedness,<br />
When I, with slow and softening pen,<br />
Have gone o'er all the tints agen,<br />
Shall urge a bold and proper claim,<br />
To level half the ancient fame;<br />
While future ages, yet unknown,<br />
With critic air shall proudly own<br />
Thy <i>Hogarth</i> first of every clime<br />
For humour keen, or strong sublime, &amp;c."<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It is but justice, on one hand, to add, that when <i>Lloyd</i> wrote
this eulogium, he was not yet enlisted under the banners of
fashion; but impartiality, on the other hand, requires we
should observe that, having, like <i>Hogarth</i>, seen few pictures
by the best masters, he was treating of an art he did not understand.
</p>
<p>
The authors of the <i>Monthly Review</i> are of opinion, that
<i>Mr. Walpole</i> speaks too contemptuously of <i>Sigismunda</i>, and that
there is no ground for the insinuation that the person for
whom it was painted thought meanly of it. "We have in
our possession (say they) a letter to <i>Hogarth</i> from the noble
person referred to, in which he expresses himself in the following
terms;&mdash;<i>I really think the performance so striking and
inimitable, that the constantly having it before one's eyes, would
be often occasioning melancholy ideas to arise in one's mind, which,
a curtain being drawn before it, would not diminish in the least.</i>"
Surely this epistle, if genuine, was ironical. Or shall we suppose
that, afterwards, his lordship only saw the picture through
the disgusting medium of the price? Mr. <i>Wilkes's</i> opinion of
the piece will be best conveyed in his own words, which are
therefore copied in note <a href="#Footnote_65_84">65</a>, below.
</p>
<p>
Dr. <i>Morell</i>, an intimate friend of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, who was applied
to for information, returned for answer: "His excellencies,
as well as his foibles, are so universally known, that I cannot
add to the former, and would not, if I could, to the
latter. I should think we lived in a very ill-natured world,
if the whims and follies in a man's life were to be exposed,
and his oddities and mistakes, <i>ubi plura nitent</i>, seriously condemned.
But the unhappy affair of <i>Sigismunda</i> requires animadversion.
And I will venture to say that even this <i>Sigismunda</i>
would not have deserved so many hard things as
have been said of it, if Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> had timely and properly
observed the caution&mdash;<i>Manum de Tabula</i>. But it was
so altered, upon the criticism of one Connoisseur or another;
and especially when, relying no longer upon strength
of genius, he had recourse to the <i>feigned</i> tears and <i>fictitious</i>
woe of a female friend; that, when it appeared at the exhibition,
I scarce knew it again myself, and from a passable
picture it became little better than the wretched figure
here represented. In my opinion, I never saw a finer resemblance
of flesh and blood, while the canvas was warm,
I mean <i>wet</i>; but, like that of real flesh, as soon as it was
chilled, the beauty wore off. And this, he said, could not
be helped, as no colours, but those of pure nature, as
<i>ultramarine</i>, &amp;c. would keep their natural brightness. But
it is granted that colouring was not Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> forte;
and the subject we are upon is a disagreeable one."</p></div>

<p>
"The humourous Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, the <i>supposed</i> author of the
<i>Analysis of Beauty</i>, has at last entered the list of politicians,
and given us a print of <i>The Times. Words are man's province</i>,
says <i>Pope</i>; but they are not Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> province. He
somewhere mentions his being indebted to a friend for a
third part of the <i>wording</i>: that is his phrase. We all titter
the instant he takes up a <i>pen</i>, but we tremble when we see
the <i>pencil</i> in his hand. I will do him the justice to say, that
he possesses the rare talent of gibbetting in colours, and
that in most of his works he has been a very good moral satirist.
His forte is there, and he should have kept it. When
he has at any time deviated from <i>his own peculiar walk</i>, he
has never failed to make himself perfectly ridiculous. I
need only make my appeal to any one of his <i>historical</i> or
<i>portrait</i> pieces, which are now considered as almost beneath
all criticism. The favourite <i>Sigismunda</i>, the labour of so
many years, the boasted effort of his art, was not <i>human</i>.
If the figure had a resemblance of any thing ever on earth,
or had the least pretence to meaning or expression, it was
what he had seen, or perhaps made, in real life, his own
wife in an agony of passion; but of what passion no connoisseur
could guess. All his friends remember what tiresome
discourses were held by him day after day about the
transcendent merit of it, and how the great names of <i>Raphael,
Vandyke,</i> and others, were made to yield the palm of
beauty, grace, expression, &amp;c. to him, for this long laboured,
yet still, <i>uninteresting</i>, single figure. The value he
himself set on this, as well as on some other of his works,
almost exceeds belief; yet from politeness or fear, or some
other motives, he has actually been paid the most astonishing
sums, as the price, not of his merit, but of his unbounded
vanity.
</p>
<p>
"The darling passion of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> is to shew the <i>faulty</i>
and <i>dark</i> side of every object. He never gives us in perfection
the <i>fair face of nature</i>, but admirably well holds out
her deformities to ridicule. The reason is plain. All objects
are painted on his <i>retina</i> in a grotesque manner, and
he has never felt the force of what the <i>French</i> call <i>la belle
nature</i>. He never caught a single idea of beauty, grace, or
elegance; but, on the other hand, he never missed the least
flaw in almost any production of nature or of art. This is
his true character. He has succeeded very happily in the
way of humour, and has miscarried in every other attempt.
This has arisen in some measure from his head, but much
more from his heart. After <i>Marriage à&nbsp;la Mode</i>, the public
wished for a series of prints of a <i>happy</i> marriage. <i>Hogarth</i>
made the attempt, but the rancour and malevolence of his
mind made him very soon turn with envy and disgust from
objects of so pleasing contemplation, to dwell and feast a
bad heart on others of a hateful cast, which he pursued,
for he found them congenial, with the most unabating zeal,
and unrelenting gall.
</p>
<p>
"I have observed some time his <i>setting sun</i>. He has long
been very <i>dim</i>, and almost <i>shorn of his beams</i>. He seems so
conscious of this, that he now glimmers with <i>borrowed light.
John Bull's house in flames</i> has been hackney'd in fifty different
prints; and if there is any merit in the figure on stilts,
and the mob prancing around, it is not to be ascribed to
<i>Hogarth</i>, but to <i>Callot</i>. That spirited <i>Italian</i>, whom the
<i>English</i> painter has so carefully studied, has given us in the
<i>Balli di Sfessania di Jacomo Callot</i>, the very same ideas, but
infinitely more ludicrous in the execution. The piece is
<i>Smaraolo cornuto. Ratsa di Boio. The Times</i> must be confessed
destitute of every kind of original merit. The print
at first view appears too much crouded with figures; and is
in every part confused, perplexed, and embarrassed. The
<i>story is not well told to the eye</i>; nor can we any where discover
the faintest ray of that genius, which with a few strokes of
the pencil enabled us to penetrate into the deepest recesses
of thought, and even caprice, in a <i>rake</i>, a <i>harlot</i>, and a <i>profligate
young man of quality</i>.
</p>
<p>
"I own too that I am grieved to see the genius of <i>Hogarth</i>,
which should take in all ages and countries, sunk to a level
with the miserable tribe of party-etchers, and now, in his
rapid decline, entering into the poor politics of the faction
of the day, and descending into low personal abuse, instead
of instructing the world, as he could once, by manly moral
satire. Whence can proceed so surprizing a change? Is it
the frowardness of old age? Or is it that envy and impatience
of resplendent merit in every way, at which he has
always sickened? How often has he been remarked to droop
at the fair and honest applause given even to a friend,
though he had particular obligations to the very same gentleman!
What wonder then that some of the most respectable
characters of the age become the objects of his ridicule?
It is sufficient that the rest of mankind applaud;
from that moment he begins the attack, and you never can
be well with him, till he hears an universal outcry against
you, and till all your friends have given you up. There is
besides a silly affectation of singularity, joined to a strong
desire of leading the rest of the world: when that is once
found impracticable, the spleen engendered on such an occasion
is discharged at a particular object, or ends in a general
misanthropy. The public never had the least share of
<i>Hogarth's</i> regard, or even good-will. <i>Gain</i> and <i>vanity</i> have
steered his little bark quite through life. He has never
been consistent but with respect to those two principles.
What a despicable part has he acted with regard to the society
of <i>Arts and Sciences</i>! How shuffling has his conduct
been to the whole body of <i>Artists</i>! Both these useful societies
have experienced the most ungenteel and offensive behaviour
from him. There is at this hour scarcely a single
man of any degree of merit in his own profession, with
whom he does not hold a professed enmity. It is impossible
the least degree of friendship could ever subsist in this intercourse
of the arts with him; for his insufferable vanity
will never allow the least merit in another, and no man of
a liberal turn of mind will ever condescend to feed his pride
with the gross and fulsome praise he expects, or to burn the
incense he claims, and indeed snuffs like a most gracious
god. To this he joins no small share of jealousy; in consequence
of which, he has all his life endeavoured to suppress
rising merit, and has been very expert in every mean underhand
endeavour, to extinguish the least spark of genuine
fire. Rut all <i>genius</i> was not born, nor will die, with Mr.
<i>Hogarth</i>: and notwithstanding all his ungenerous efforts to
damp or chill it in another, I will trust to a discerning and
liberal spirit in the <i>English</i> nation, to patronize and reward
all real merit. It will in the end rise superior to the idle
laugh of the hour, which these triflers think it the highest
praise to be able to raise. For my part, I scarcely know a
more profligate principle, than the indiscriminately sacrificing
every thing, however great or good, to the dangerous
talent of ridicule; and a man, whose sole object is <i>dummodo
risum excutiat</i>, ought to be avoided as the worst pest of society,
as the <i>enemy</i> most to be feared, I mean a treacherous
<i>friend</i>. Such a man will go all lengths to raise a laugh at
your expence, and your whole life will be made miserable
from his ambition of diverting the company for half an
hour.
</p>
<p>
"I love to trace the ideas of a Genius, and to mark the
progress of every art. Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> has heard much of
the <i>cobwebs</i> of the law, and the <i>spinning fine spider-webs</i>, &amp;c.
This is thrown on paper, and the idea carefully treasured.
Lord <i>Hardwicke</i> being at the head of the law, and deservedly
in as high esteem with his countrymen as any man who
ever held the seals, unspotted in life, and equally revered
by prince and people, becomes an excellent subject for the
satirical pencil of a malevolent painter. He is accordingly
emblematically represented by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> as a great spider
in a large, thick web, with myriads of the carcases of <i>flies,
clients</i> I suppose, sucked to death by the gloomy tyrant.
Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> had heard of Mr. <i>Pitt's</i> being <i>above</i> all his
fellow-citizens, and of his superior virtue having <i>raised</i> him
to an envied and dangerous <i>height</i> of grandeur. Now this
he has taken literally, and, with the kind aid of <i>Callot</i>, has
put Mr. <i>Pitt</i> on stilts, and made the people <i>look up</i> to him;
which, after all this insipid ridicule, they will continue to
do, as a kind of tutelar deity, from whom they expect
that security and those blessings they despair of from others.
As to the conceit of the <i>bellows</i>, to signify, I suppose, Mr.
<i>Pitt's</i> endeavours to blow up the flames of war and discord,
it is at once very poor and very false. His whole conduct
the last session in parliament, and out of the house ever
since, has demonstrated the contrary: <i>neque vero hoc</i> oratione
<i>solum, sed multo magis</i> vitâ <i>et</i> moribus <i>comprobavit.</i>
Cic. de Fin.
</p>
<p>
"Lord <i>Temple</i> is a nobleman of fine parts and unsullied honour,
who has shewn a thorough disinterestedness, a great
love of liberty, and a steady attachment to the public, in
every part of his conduct through life. It was impossible
such a character could be missed by the poisonous shafts of
envy, which we see pointed at all superior virtue....
Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> wit on this noble lord is confined to the
wretched conceits of the <i>Temple Coffee-house</i>, and a <i>squirt</i> to
signify the <i>playing on</i> the ministry. I really believe this wit
is all Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> own.
</p>
<p>
"When a man of parts dedicates his talents to the service
of his country, he deserves the highest rewards: when he
makes them subservient to base purposes, he merits execration
and punishment. Among the <i>Spartans</i>, music and poetry
were made to serve the noblest purposes of the <i>Lacedemonian</i>
state. A manly courage and great contempt of
death were inspired by them; and the poet, musician, soldier,
and patriot, were often the same good citizen, who
despised the low <i>mechanic lucre</i> of the profession, and was
zealous only for the glory of his country. In the year
1746, when the <i>Guards</i> were ordered to march to <i>Finchley</i>,
on the most important service they could be employed in,
the extinguishing a <i>Scottish</i> rebellion, which threatened the
intire ruin of the illustrious family on the throne, and, in
consequence, of our liberties, Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> came out with
a print to make them ridiculous to their countrymen and to
all <i>Europe</i>; or perhaps it rather was to tell the <i>Scots</i> in his
way how little the Guards were to be feared, and that they
might safely advance. That the ridicule might not stop
here, and that it might be as offensive as possible to his own
<i>sovereign</i>, he dedicated the print to the king of <i>Pru[s]ia</i><a name="FNanchor_A_85" id="FNanchor_A_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_85" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
<i>as an encourager of arts</i>. Is this patriotism! In old <i>Rome</i>,
or in any of the <i>Grecian</i> states, he would have been punished
as a profligate citizen, totally devoid of all principle.
In <i>England</i> he is rewarded, and made <i>serjeant</i> painter to
that very king's grandson. I think the term means the
same as what is vulgarly called <i>house</i>-painter; and indeed
he has not been suffered to <i>caricature</i> the royal family. The
post of portrait-painter is given to a <i>Scotsman</i>, one <i>Ramsay</i>.
Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> is only to paint the wainscot of the rooms, or,
in the phrase of the art, may be called their <i>pannel-painter</i>.
But how have the <i>Guards</i> offended Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, for he is
again attacking them in <i>The Times</i>? Lord <i>Harrington's</i> second
troop of grenadier guards is allowed to be very perfect
in every part of military discipline; and <i>Hogarth's</i> friend,
the king of <i>Prussia</i>, could have shewn him the real importance
of it. He had heard them much applauded, and
therefore must abuse them. The ridicule ends however in
airs composed by <i>Harrington</i>, and in a piece of <i>clock-work</i>;
but he ought to have known, that though <i>l'homme machine</i>
is not sound philosophy, it is the true doctrine of tactics.
</p>
<p>
"The <i>Militia</i> has received so many just testimonies of applause,
both from their king and country, that the attack
of envy and malevolence was long expected. But I dare say
this poor jester will have Mr. <i>George Townshend's</i> free consent
to vent his spleen upon him and the gentlemen of <i>Norfolk</i>.
I believe he may ever go on in this way almost unnoticed;
at one time ridiculing the <i>Guards</i> for a <i>disorderly</i>, and at
another the <i>Militia</i> for an exact and <i>orderly</i> march. Mr.
<i>Townshend</i> will still have the warm applause of his country,
and the truest satisfaction, that of an honest heart, for his
patriot labours in establishing this great plan of internal defence,
a <i>Militia</i>, which has delivered us from the ignominy
of <i>foreign hirelings</i>, and the ridiculous fears of invasion, by
a brave and well-disciplined body of <i>Englishmen</i>, at all times
ready and zealous for the defence of their country, and of
its laws and constitution."</p>

abilities; while the <i>Cheshire</i> cheese, with 3000 <i>l.</i> on it,
seemed to imply that he himself merited an annual pension.
</p>
<p>
I received this explanation from an ingenious friend.&mdash;The
late Mr. <i>Rogers</i> explained it thus: "Mr. <i>Pitt</i> is represented
in it sitting at his ease [in the position of the great
Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i> in <i>Westminster-Abbey</i>], with a mill-stone
hanging over his head, on which is written 3000 <i>l.</i> in allusion
to his saying, that <i>Hanover</i> was a mill-stone round the neck
of <i>England</i>, on account of the expences attending it; and his
afterwards adding himself to the public expences by accepting
a pension of 3000 <i>l.</i> a year. He is firing a mortar-piece
levelled at a Dove bearing an olive-branch (the symbol
of peace) perched on the standard of <i>England</i>; and is supported
by the City of <i>London</i>, denoted by the two Giants in
<i>Guildhall. Hogarth</i> is flogging <i>Wilkes</i> and <i>Churchill</i>, and
making them dance to the scrapings of a fidler; designed
to represent a Nobleman [Earl <i>Temple</i>], who patronized
them in 1763, and who, for his unmeaning face, has ever
been described without a feature. See <i>Trusler's</i> Preface,
p. vii."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_92" id="Footnote_72_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_92"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> It may be worth observing, that in "Independence," a
poem which was not published by <i>Churchill</i> till the last week of
<i>September</i>, 1764, he considers his antagonist as a departed
Genius:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<i>Hogarth</i> would draw him (Envy must allow)<br />
E'en to the life, <span class="smcap">was Hogarth living now</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
How little did the sportive Satirist imagine that the power of
pleasing was so soon to cease in both! <i>Hogarth</i> died in four
weeks after the publication of this poem; and <i>Churchill</i> survived
him but nine days. In some lines which were printed in
<i>November</i> 1764, the compiler of these Anecdotes took occasion
to lament that
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"&mdash;&mdash;Scarce had the friendly tear,<br />
For <i>Hogarth</i> shed, escap'd the generous eye<br />
Of feeling Pity, when again it flow'd<br />
For <i>Churchill's</i> fate. Ill can we bear the loss<br />
Of Fancy's twin-born offspring, close ally'd<br />

on subscribing, the other on the delivery of "A Dictionary
of Arts and Sciences," in two large folio volumes. Many
of the nobility, as well as gentry subscribed; but very few of
them made good their second payments, or had the work;
and the author dedicated it (in gratitude, it is supposed, for
the generous patronage he received from the <i>English</i>) to
Marshal <i>Belleisle</i>; whose place of confinement was in <i>The

<p><a name="Footnote_80_100" id="Footnote_80_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_100"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> In the year 1768 was published a work, intituled, "<i>Hogarth</i>
Moralised. Being a complete Edition of <i>Hogarth's</i>
Works. Containing near Fourscore Copper-Plates, most
elegantly engraved. With an Explanation, pointing out
the many Beauties that may have hitherto escaped Notice,
and a Comment on their Moral Tendency, &amp;c. With the
Approbation of <i>Jane Hogarth</i>, Widow of the late Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>."
</p>
<p>
The history of the work is as follows: The Rev. <i>John
Trusler</i> engaged with some engravers in this design, after <i>Hogarth's</i>
death, when they could carry it into execution with
impunity. Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>, finding her property would be much
affected by it, was glad to accept an offer they made her, of
entering into partnership with them; and they were very glad
to receive her, knowing her name would give credit to the
publication, and that she would certainly supply many anecdotes
to explain the plates. Such as are found in the work
are probably all hers. The other stuff was introduced by the
editor to eke out the book. We are informed, that, when
the undertaking was completed, in order to get rid of her
partners, she was glad to buy out their shares, so that the
whole expence which fell on her amounted to at least 700 <i>l.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_81_101" id="Footnote_81_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_101"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> "They abound," says an excellent judge, "in true humour;
and satire, which is generally well-directed: they
are admirable moral lessons, and afford a fund of entertainment
suited to every taste: a circumstance, which shews
them to be just copies of nature." We may consider them
too as valuable repositories of the manners, customs, and
dresses of the present age. What amusement would a collection
of this kind afford, drawn from every period of the
history of <i>Britain!</i>&mdash;How far the works of <i>Hogarth</i> will
bear a critical examination, may be the subject of a little
more enquiry. In design <i>Hogarth</i> was seldom at a loss. His
invention was fertile, and his judgement accurate. An improper
incident is rarely introduced; a proper one rarely
omitted. No one could tell a story better; or make it, in
all its circumstances, more intelligible. His genius, however,
it must be owned, was suited only to low, or familiar
subjects. It never soared above common life: to subjects
naturally sublime, or which from antiquity, or other accidents,
borrowed dignity, he could not rise. In composition
we see little in him to admire. In many of his prints,
the deficiency is so great, as plainly to imply a want of all
principle; which makes us ready to believe, that when we
do meet with a beautiful group, it is the effect of chance.
In one of his minor works, the Idle Prentice, we seldom
see a crowd more beautifully managed, than in the last
print. If the sheriff's officers had not been placed in a line,
and had been brought a little lower in the picture, so as to
have formed a pyramid with the cart, the composition had
been unexceptionable: and yet the first print of this work
is so striking an instance of disagreeable composition, that
it is amazing, how an artist, who had any idea of beautiful
forms, could suffer so unmasterly a performance to leave
his hands. Of the distribution of light <i>Hogarth</i> had as
little knowledge as of composition. In some of his pieces
we see a good effect; as in the execution just mentioned;
in which, if the figures at the right and left corners had
been kept down a little, the light would have been beautifully
distributed on the fore-ground, and a little fine secondary
light spread over part of the crowd: but at the
same time there is so obvious a deficiency in point of effect,
in most of his prints, that it is very evident he had no principles.
Neither was <i>Hogarth</i> a master in drawing. Of the
muscles and anatomy of the head and hands he had perfect
knowledge; but his trunks are often badly moulded, and
his limbs ill set on. I tax him with plain bad drawing; I
speak not of the niceties of anatomy, and elegance of outline:
of these indeed he knew nothing; nor were they of
use in that mode of design which he cultivated: and yet his
figures, upon the whole, are inspired with so much life
and meaning, that the eye is kept in good humour, in spite
of its inclination to find fault. The author of the Analysis
of Beauty, it might be supposed, would have given us more
instances of grace, than we find in the works of <i>Hogarth</i>;
which shews strongly that theory and practice are not always
united. Many opportunities his subjects naturally afford of
introducing graceful attitudes; and yet we have very few
examples of them. With instances of picturesque grace
his works abound. Of his expression, in which the force
of his genius lay, we cannot speak in terms too high. In
every mode of it he was truly excellent. The passions he
thoroughly understood, and all the effects which they produce
in every part of the human frame: he had the happy
art also of conveying his ideas with the same precision with
which he conceived them.&mdash;He was excellent too in expressing
any humorous oddity, which we often see stamped
upon the human face. All his heads are cast in the very
mould of nature. Hence that endless variety, which is displayed
through his works: and hence it is, that the difference
arises between his heads, and the affected caricaturas
of those masters, who have sometimes amused themselves
with patching together an assemblage of features from their
own ideas. Such are <i>Spagniolet's</i>; which, though admirably
executed, appear plainly to have no archetypes in nature.
<i>Hogarth's</i>, on the other hand, are collections of natural curiosities.
The <i>Oxford-heads</i>, the physicians-arms, and some
of his other pieces, are expressly of this humorous kind.
They are truly comic; though ill-natured effusions of
mirth: more entertaining than <i>Spagniolet's</i>, as they are pure
nature; but less innocent, as they contain ill-directed ridicule.&mdash;But
the species of expression, in which this master
perhaps most excels, is that happy art of catching those peculiarities
of air, and gesture, which the ridiculous part of
every profession contract; and which, for that reason, become
characteristics of the whole. His counsellors, his undertakers,
his lawyers, his usurers, are all conspicuous at
sight. In a word, almost every profession may see, in his
works, that particular species of affectation which they
should most endeavour to avoid. The execution of this
master is well-suited to his subjects, and manner of treating
them. He etches with great spirit; and never gives one
unnecessary stroke. For myself, I greatly more value the
works of his own needle, than those high-finished prints on
which he employed other engravers. For as the production
of an effect is not his talent; and as this is the chief excellence
of high finishing; his own rough manner is certainly
preferable; in which we have most of the force and spirit
of his expression. The manner in none of his works
pleases me so well as in a small print of a corner of a play-house.
There is more spirit in a work of this kind, struck
off at once, warm from the imagination, than in all the
cold correctness of an elaborate engraving. If all his works
had been executed in this style, with a few improvements in
the compositions, and the management of light, they would
certainly have been a much more valuable collection of
prints than they are. The Rake's Progress, and some of
his other works, are both etched and engraved by himself:
they are well done; but it is plain he meant them as furniture.
As works designed for a critick's eye, they would
certainly have been better without the engraving, except a
few touches in a very few places. The want of effect too
would have been less conspicuous, which in his highest-finished
prints is disagreeably striking." <i>Gilpin, Essay on
Prints,</i> p. 165.</p></div>

F. A. S. were communicated by Dr. <i>Ducarel</i>, who was personally
acquainted with Mr. <i>Tothall</i>, and received the intelligence
in a letter from the Rev. Mr. <i>Lyon</i>, Minister of <i>St.
Mary's</i> at <i>Dover</i>, to whom the particulars in it were related
by Captain <i>Bulstrode</i> of that town.
</p>
<p><br />
"<i>Dover, June</i> 11, 1781.</p>
<p>"Sir,</p>
<p>
"The following narrative of your friend <i>Tothall</i> may be depended
upon, as Captain <i>Bulstrode</i> informs me he frequently
heard it from <i>Tothall</i> himself. His father was an apothecary
in <i>Fleet-street</i>; but dying, as Captain <i>Bulstrode</i> thinks,
while his son was young, and in but indifferent circumstances
(as his mother afterwards practised as a midwife),
he was taken by an uncle, who was a fishmonger. He lived
with his uncle some time; but, not approving of the business,
ran away from him, and entered on board a merchant-ship
going to <i>The West Indies</i>. He also went several times to
<i>Newfoundland</i>. During the time of his being in <i>The West
Indies</i>, though so early in life, he was indefatigable in the
collecting of shells, and brought home several utterly unknown
in <i>England</i>. He continued at sea till he was almost
30 years of age. In one of his voyages he was taken by
the <i>Spaniards</i>, and marched a considerable way up the
country, without shoe or stocking, with only a woollen cap
on his head, and a brown waistcoat on, with a large staff
in his hand. He had afterwards his picture drawn in this
dress. He continued a prisoner till exchanged.
</p>
<p>
"When he was about 30 years of age, he went as shopman
to a woollen-draper at the corner of <i>Tavistock Court, Covent
Garden,</i> with whom he continued some years; and his master,
finding him a faithful servant, told him, 'as he dealt
only in cloth, and his customers were taylors, he would
lend him money to buy shalloons and trimmings, and recommend
him to his chapmen, if he liked to take the trouble
and the profit of the branch upon himself.' He readily
accepted the proposal.
</p>
<p>
"About the same time an acquaintance in <i>The West Indies</i>
sent him a puncheon of rum. Before he landed it, he consulted
his master what he should do with it; who advised
him to sell it out in small quantities, and lent him a cellar
in his house. He followed this advice; and, finding the
profits considerable, wrote to his correspondent in <i>The West
Indies</i> to send him another supply; and from this time he
commenced rum, brandy, and shalloon merchant.
</p>
<p>
"I cannot learn how long he continued in this way; but
his master having acquired a fortune, and being desirous of
retiring from business, left him in possession of his whole
stock at prime cost, and he was to pay him as he sold it.
He now commenced woollen-draper, and continued in this
business till he acquired a sum sufficient, as he thought, to
retire upon; and he left his business to his shopman, the
late Mr. <i>Job Ray</i>, on the same conditions his master left it
to him.
</p>
<p>
"During his residence in <i>Covent Garden</i>, he became a member
of the club at the <i>Bedford Coffee-house</i>, and of course
contracted an acquaintance with <i>Hogarth, Lambert,</i> and other
men eminent in their way; and <i>Hogarth</i> lived some time in
his house on the footing of a most intimate friend.
</p>
<p>
"On quitting his business (being troubled with an asthmatical
complaint) he came and settled at <i>Dover</i>; where, soon
becoming connected with certain persons in the smuggling
branch, he fitted out a bye-boat, which was designed (as is
supposed) to promote their business; but in this branch
Fortune, which had hitherto smiled upon his endeavours,
now frowned upon his attempts. The vessel, in going over
with horses either to <i>Ostend</i> or <i>Flushing</i>, was lost. This,
with some other losses, so reduced him, that he was rather
straitened in his circumstances, and he could not live as he
had done previous to the losses he sustained.
</p>
<p>
"His residence was near the Rope-walk at <i>Dover</i> (since
pulled down), where his old friend <i>Hogarth</i> frequently visited
him: but being in a decline, and his asthma increasing,
he bought a very small cottage at <i>West Langdon</i>, about three
miles from <i>Dover</i>, to which he used to go on horseback.
Digging in a very small garden belonging to this cottage,
he had the good fortune to find some valuable fossils; which
to a man of his taste was a singular treasure. He died
<i>January</i> 9, 1768, at the age of 70 (possessed of about
1500 <i>l.</i>), and was buried at <i>St. Mary's Church</i> at <i>Dover</i>.
His collection of shells and fossils were sold by auction at
<i>Longford's</i>, the following year.
</p>
<p>
"The foregoing is the substance of what I have gathered
from Capt. <i>Bulstrode</i>. If there should be any other particular
which you are desirous of knowing, I shall be happy
to make the inquiry, and to communicate it; and am, Sir,
your most obedient humble servant,

OF
HOGARTH'S PRINTS.<a name="FNanchor_1_111" id="FNanchor_1_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_111" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>I am now engaged in an undertaking, which
from its nature will be imperfect. While <i>Hogarth</i>
was yet an apprentice, and worked on his
master's account, we may suppose he was not at liberty
to affix his name to his own performances.
Nay, afterwards, when he appeared as an independent
artist, he probably left many of them anonymous,
being sometimes obliged to measure out his
exertions in proportion to the scanty prices paid for
them. For reasons like these, we may be sure that
many of his early plates must have eluded search;
and, if gradually discovered, will serve only to swell
the collections they will not adorn.&mdash;The judicious
connoisseur, perhaps, would be content to possess
the pictures of <i>Raffaelle</i>, without aiming at a complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
assemblage of the Roman <i>Fayence</i> that passes
under his name.</p>

<p>In settling the dates of his pieces there is also difficulty.
Sometimes, indeed, they have been inferred
from circumstances almost infallible; as in respect to
the <i>Rabbit-breeder</i>,&amp;c. which would naturally have
been published in the year 1726. On other occasions
they are determined within a certain compass of time.
Thus the <i>Ticket for Milward</i>, then a player at <i>Lincoln's-Inn
Fields</i>, must have preceded 1733, when he
removed with <i>Rich</i> to <i>Covent Garden</i>; and it is
equally sure, that <i>Orator Henley christening an Infant</i>,
and <i>A Girl swearing a child to a grave citizen</i>, came
out before 1735, in which year we know that <i>J. Y.
Schley</i>, one of <i>Picart's</i> coadjutors, had re-engraved
them both for the use of the fourth volume of the
<i>Religious Ceremonies</i>, published at <i>Amsterdam</i> in 1736.
But how are we to guess at the period that produced
<i>Sancho at Dinner</i>, or <i>The Discovery</i>?</p>

<p>The merits and demerits of his performances
would prove deceitful guides in our researches. As
our artist grew older, he did not regularly advance
in estimation; for neither the frontispieces to <i>Tristram
Shandy</i>, the <i>Times</i>, the <i>Bathos</i>, or the <i>Bear</i>, can be
said to equal many of his earliest productions.&mdash;Under
such difficulties is the following chronological list of
our author's pieces attempted.</p>

<p>The reader is likewise entreated to observe, that
throughout the annexed catalogue of plates, variations,
&amp;c. <i>J. N.</i> has mentioned only such as he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
seen. Alike unwilling to deceive or be deceived, he
has suppressed all intelligence he could not authenticate
from immediate inspection. He might easily
have enlarged his work by admitting particulars of
doubtful authority, sometimes imperfectly recollected
by their several communicators, and sometimes offered
as sportive impositions on an author's credulity.
Of this weakness every one possesses some; but perhaps
no man more than he who ambitiously seeks opportunities
to improve on the labours of another.
<i>J. N.</i> is sure, however, that Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, whom none
can exceed in taste and judgment, will be little concerned
about the merits of a performance that
founds its claim to notice only on the humbler pretences
of industry and correctness.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that <i>London</i> always affords a set
of itinerant poets, whose office it is to furnish inscriptions
for satirical engravings. I lately overheard
one of these unfortunate sons of the Muse making a
bargain with his employer. "Your print," says he,
"is a taking one, and why won't you go to the price
of a half-crown Epigram?" From such hireling
bards, I suppose, our artist purchased not a few of
the wretched rhimes under his early performances,
unless he himself be considered as the author of them.</p>

<h4>1723.</h4>


<p>1. Fifteen plates to <i>Aubry de la Motraye's</i> "Travels
through <i>Europe, Asia,</i> and Part of <i>Africa</i>." <i>W. Hogarth
sculp.</i> on fourteen of them; viz. plates V. IX. X.<a name="FNanchor_1_114" id="FNanchor_1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_114" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>

XXXIII. 1. XXXIII. 2. XXXV. XXXVIII. One
of these (viz. XXX.) contains a portrait of <i>Charles</i>
the XIIth of <i>Sweden</i>. Several of the pictures, from
which the Seraglio, &amp;c. were engraved, are still in
being, and are undoubtedly authentic, being painted
in <i>Turkey</i>, and brought home by <i>De la Motraye</i>, at
his return from his travels. They were sold about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
twenty-five years ago at <i>Hackney</i>, for a mere trifle,
together with the plates to the present work. The
latter, in all probability, are destroyed. This book
was originally published in <i>English</i> at <i>London</i>, 1723;
afterwards in <i>French</i> at <i>The Hague</i>, in 1727; and
again in <i>English</i><a name="FNanchor_3_116" id="FNanchor_3_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_116" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> at <i>London</i>, revised by the author;
with the addition of two new cuts, in 1730. In the
<i>French</i> edition, Plate V. Tom. I. is engraved by
<i>R. Smith</i>, instead of <i>Hogarth</i>, so that this intermediate
copy contains only fourteen plates by him. It
is probable also, that some other anonymous ones, in
all the editions, were by the same engraver. His
reputation, indeed, will save more than it loses by the
want of his signature to establish their authenticity.</p>

identical edition of 1723, with the addition of a Preface and
an Appendix. New title-pages were again printed to it, and
a third volume added, in 1732.</p><br /></div>


<p>2. Five <i>Muscovites</i>. This small print appears at
the corner of one of the maps to the second volume
of the foregoing work. It has no intelligible reference;
but, in the <i>English</i> copy now before me, is
the last plate but one, and is marked. C&mdash;T. II. In
a former edition of the present catalogue, it was
enumerated as a separate article, but must now be
reckoned as one of the fifteen plates to <i>Motraye's</i>
Travels.</p>

<p>To these I might add three plates more. If <i>Hogarth</i>
engraved the <i>Muscovites</i> at the corner of the map
already mentioned, he likewise furnished the figures
in the corner of another, marked T. I.&mdash;B. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Plate T. I.&mdash;XVI. and T. I.&mdash;XXXVII. I have likewise
reason to suppose were the works of our artist;
eighteen plates in all; though the three latter being
only conjectural, I have not ventured to set them
down as indisputed performances. Of the <i>Muscovites</i>
there is a modern copy.<a name="FNanchor_1_117" id="FNanchor_1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_117" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I have just been assured by a gentleman of undoubted
veracity, that he was once possessed of a set
of plates engraved by <i>Hogarth</i> for some treatise on
mathematicks; but, considering them of little value,
disposed of them at the price of the copper. As
our artist could have displayed no marks of genius
in representations of cycloids, diagrams, and equilateral
triangles, the loss of these plates is not heavily
to be lamented.</p>

<h4>1724.</h4>


<p>1. Seven small prints to "The New Metamorphosis
of <i>Lucius Apuleius</i> of <i>Medaura. London</i>,
printed for <i>Sam. Briscoe</i>, 1724." 12mo. 2 vol.
I. Frontispiece. II. Festivals of Gallantry, which
the noblemen of <i>Rome</i> make in the churches for the
entertainment of their mistresses. III. The banditti's
bringing home a beautiful virgin, called <i>Camilla</i>,
from her mother's arms, the night before she was to
have been married. Vol. I. p. 113. No name to
this plate. IV. <i>Fantasio's</i> arrival at the house of an
old witch, who is afterwards changed into a beautiful
young lady. V. The provincial of the Jesuits'
recovery of his favourite dog from the cooper's wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
VI. <i>Psyche's</i> admission of her unknown husband in
the dark, who always departed before the return of
light. VII. Cardinal <i>Ottoboni</i> and his niece's visit to
an Hermitage in the holy desart, called <i>Camaldule</i>;
the Cardinal's discourse against solitude to the hermit,
who had not been out of his cell, nor spoke a
word, for forty years together. Plate IV. is the only
one that has the least trait of character in it.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>2. Masquerades and operas. <i>Burlington-gate. W.
Hogarth inv. &amp; sculp.</i> Of the three small figures in
the center of this plate, the middle one is Lord
<i>Burlington</i>, a man of considerable taste in Painting
and Architecture, but who ranked Mr. <i>Kent</i> (an indifferent
artist) above his merit. On one side of the
peer is Mr. <i>Campbell</i>, the architect; on the other,
his lordship's postilion. On a show-cloth in this plate
is also supposed to be the portrait of King <i>George</i> II.
who gave 1000 <i>l.</i> towards the masquerade; together
with that of the Earl of <i>Peterborough</i>, who offers
<i>Cuzzoni</i>, the <i>Italian</i> singer, 8000 <i>l.</i> and she spurns at
him.<a name="FNanchor_1_118" id="FNanchor_1_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_118" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mr. <i>Heidegger</i>, the regulator of the Masquerade,
is also exhibited, looking out at a window,
with the letter <i>H.</i> under him. The substance of the
foregoing remarks is taken from a collection lately
belonging to Captain <i>Baillie</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_119" id="FNanchor_2_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_119" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> where it is said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
they were furnished by an eminent Connoisseur.<a name="FNanchor_3_120" id="FNanchor_3_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_120" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
A board is likewise displayed, with the words&mdash;"Long
Room. <i>Fawks's</i> dexterity of hand." It appears
front the following advertisement in <i>Mist's
Weekly Journal</i> for <i>Saturday, December</i> 25, 1725,
that this artist was a man of great consequence in
his profession. "Whereas the town hath lately been
alarmed, that the famous <i>Fawks</i> was robbed and
murdered, returning from performing at the
Dutchess of <i>Buckingham's</i> house at <i>Chelsea</i>; which
report being raised and printed by a person to gain
money to himself, and prejudice the above mentioned Mr.
<i>Fawks</i>, whose unparalleled performances
have gained him so much applause from the
greatest of quality, and most curious observers:
We think, both in justice to the injured gentleman,
and for the satisfaction of his admirers, that
we cannot please our readers better than to acquaint
them he is alive, and will not only perform his
usual surprizing dexterity of hand, posture-master,
and musical clock; but for the greater diversion
of the quality and gentry, has agreed with the famous
<i>Powell</i> of <i>The Bath</i> for the season, who has
the largest, richest, and most natural figures, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
finest machines in <i>England</i>, and whose former performances
in <i>Covent Garden</i> were so engaging to
the town, as to gain the approbation of the best
judges, to show his puppet-plays along with him,
beginning in the <i>Christmas</i> holidays next, at the
old <i>Tennis-court</i> in <i>James-Street</i>, near <i>The Haymarket</i>;
where any incredulous persons may be satisfied
he has not left this world, if they please to believe
their hands, though they can't believe their eyes."&mdash;<i>May</i>
25," indeed, "1731, died Mr. <i>Fawkes</i>,
famous for his dexterity of hand, by which he
had honestly acquired a fortune of above 10,000 <i>l.</i>
being no more than he really deserved for his great
ingenuity, by which he had surpassed all that ever
pretended to that art." Political State, vol. XLI.
p. 543.</p>

<p>This satirical performance of <i>Hogarth</i>, however,
was thought to be invented and drawn at the mitigation
of Sir <i>James Thornhill</i>, out of revenge, because
Lord <i>Burlington</i> had preferred Mr. <i>Kent</i> before him
to paint for the king at his palace at <i>Kensington</i>. Dr.
<i>Faustus</i> was a pantomime performed to crowded
houses throughout two seasons, to the utter neglect
of plays, for which reason they are cried about in a
wheel-barrow.<a name="FNanchor_4_121" id="FNanchor_4_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_121" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We may add that there are three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
prints of this small masquerade, &amp;c. one a copy
from the first. The originals have <i>Hogarth's</i> name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
within the frame of the plate, and the eight verses
are different from those under the other. It is sometimes
found without any lines at all; those in the
first instance having been engraved on a separate
piece of copper, so that they could either be retained,
dismissed, or exchanged, at pleasure. In the first
copy of this print, instead of <i>Ben Jonson's</i> name on
a label, we have <i>Pasquin</i>, N° XI. This was a periodical
paper published in 1722-3, and the number
specified is particularly severe on operas, &amp;c. The
verses to the first impression of this plate, are,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
Could now dumb <i>Faustus</i>, to reform the age,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conjure up <i>Shakespear's</i> or <i>Ben Johnson's</i> ghost,</span><br />
They'd blush for shame, to see the <i>English</i> stage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Debauch'd by fool'ries, at so great a cost.</span><br />
What would their manes say? Should they behold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Monsters and masquerades, where useful plays</span><br />
Adorn'd the fruitfull theatre of old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rival wits contended for the bays.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Price</i> 1 <i>shilling</i> 1724.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To the second impression of it:</p>

<blockquote><p>
O how refin'd, how elegant we're grown!<br />
What noble Entertainments charm the town!<br />
Whether to hear the Dragon's roar we go,<br />
Or gaze surpriz'd on <i>Fawks's</i> matchless show,<br />
Or to the Operas, or to the Masques,<br />
To eat up ortelans, and t' empty flasques,<br />
And rifle pies from <i>Shakespear's</i> clinging page,<br />
Good gods! how great's the gusto of the age.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In this print our artist has imitated the engraving of
<i>Callot</i>.</p>

<p>To the third impression, i. e. the copy:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Long has the stage productive been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of offsprings it could brag on,</span><br />
But never till this age was seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Windmill and a Dragon.</span><br />
<br />
O <i>Congreve</i>, lay thy pen aside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Shakespear</i>, thy works disown,</span><br />
Since monsters grim, and nought beside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can please this senseless town.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>I should have observed, that the idea of the foregoing
plate was stolen from an anonymous one on
the same subject. It represents <i>Hercules</i> chaining
follies and destroying monsters. He is beating <i>Heidegger</i>,
till the money he had amassed falls out of his
pocket. The situation of the buildings, &amp;c. on the
sides, &amp;c. has been followed by our artist. <i>Mercury</i>
aloft sustains a scroll, on which is written "The
Mascarade destroy'd." The inscription under this
print is "Hei Degeror. O! I am undone." <i>Price

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_121" id="Footnote_4_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_121"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Dr. <i>Faustus</i> was first brought out at <i>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</i> in
1723, and the success of it reduced the rival theatre to produce
a like entertainment at their house in 1725. From a
scarce pamphlet in octavo, without date, called "Tragi-comical
Reflections, of a moral and political Tendency,
occasioned by the present State of the two Rival Theatres
in <i>Drury-Lane</i> and <i>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</i>, by <i>Gabriel Rennel</i>,
Esq." I shall transcribe an illustration of these plates: "A
few years ago, by the help of <i>Harleykin</i>, and Dr. <i>Faustus</i>,
and <i>Pluto</i> and <i>Proserpine</i>, and other infernal persons, the
New-House was raised to as high a pitch of popularity and
renown as ever it had been known to arrive at. Tho' the
actors there consisted chiefly of <i>Scotch</i>, and <i>Irish</i>, and <i>French</i>
Strollers, who were utterly unacquainted with the <i>English</i>
Stage, and were remarkably deficient in elocution and gesture:
yet so much was the art of juggling at that time in
vogue, and so extreamly was the nation delighted with
Raree-Shows, and foreign representations, that all people
flocked to the New-House, whilst the Old one was altogether
deserted, tho' it then could glory in as excellent a set
of <i>English</i> actors as ever had trod upon any stage. In the
midst of this joyful prosperity and success, the Managers of
the New-House were not without secret uneasiness and discontent,
whenever they considered how slippery a ground
they stood upon, and how much a juster title their rivals
had to the favour and affections of the people. They were
therefore always intent upon forming designs and concerting
measures for the entire subversion of the Old-House. For
this purpose, they constantly kept in pay a standing army
of Scaramouches, who were sent about the town to possess
it with aversion and resentment against the Old Players,
whose virtues had rendered them formidable, and whose
merit was their greatest crime. These Scaramouches, in so
corrupt and degenerate a time, when blindness and folly,
and a false taste every where reigned, were every where
looked on as men of a superior skill to all other actors, and
consequently had a greater influence than the rest, and
could lead after them a larger number of followers. It was
by means of the incessant clamour and outcry that these
miscreants raised, and of the lies and forgeries which they
scattered about the nation, that the common people were
spirited up to commit the most extravagant acts of insolence
and outrage on the Managers of the Old-House. They
were made the sport and derision of fools, and were delivered
up to an enraged and deluded populace, as a prey to
the fury of wild beasts. Their enemies were continually
plotting and conspiring their destruction, and yet were continually
prosecuting them for Sham-Plots and pretended
Conspiracies, and suborning witnesses to prove them guilty
of attempts to undermine and blow up the New-House.
</p>
<p>
"During the course of those violent and illegal proceedings,
the New Actors were not wanting in any pains or expence
to gratify and increase the then popular taste for Raree-Shows,
and Hocus-Pocus Tricks. Scenes and Machines,
and Puppets, and Posture-Masters, and Actors, and Singers,
with a new set of Heathen Gods and Goddesses, and several
other foreign Decorations and Inventions, were sent for
from <i>France</i> <i>and Italy</i>, and were ready to be imported with
the first fair wind. But quarrels falling out among the
Managers of the House, and one or two of the principal
Actors happening to quit the Stage, and the people growing
tired with so much foul play, and with the same <i>deceptio
visus</i> so often repeated, the scene changed at once, the <i>vox
populi</i> turned against the New-House, which sunk under a
load of infamy and contempt, and was deserted not only by
the Spectators, but even by its Actors, who, to save themselves
from the justice of an abused and enraged people,
were forced to fly out of the nation, and to beg for protection
and subsistence from their wicked Confederates and
Fellow-Jugglers abroad."</p></div>

<h4>1725.</h4>


<p>1. Five small prints for the translation of <i>Cassandra</i>,
in five volumes duodecimo. <i>W. Hogarth inv. &amp; sculp.</i><br />
<br /></p>


<p>2. Fifteen head pieces for "The <i>Roman</i> Military
Punishments, by <i>John Beaver</i>, Esq. <i>London</i>. From
the happy Revolution, Anno xxxvii." (i. e. 1725.)
Small quarto, pp. 155. From the preface it should
seem that the author had been Judge Advocate. The
book is divided into seventeen chapters, each of
which, except the second, third, seventh, and twelfth,
have small head-pieces prefixed, of ancient military
punishments, in the manner of <i>Callot's</i> Small Miseries
of War. <i>W. Hogarth inv. &amp; sculp.</i> In 1779, were
first sold by a printseller ten of these prints, together
with two others not in the book, being scenes of
modern war; a pair of drums being in one, and a
soldier armed with a musket in the other. Thus are
there three prints in the book not in this set; viz.
Chap. 9. Soldiers sold for slaves. 10. Degradation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
16. Banishment. There is also in the title-page a
little figure of a <i>Roman</i> General sitting; probably
done by <i>Hogarth</i>, though his name is not under it.</p>

<p>In the year 1774, these plates were in the possession
of a Button-manufacturer at <i>Birmingham</i>. There
are only eleven, one of them being engraved on both
sides. They were given by him, however, to my
informant, who parted with them to <i>S. Harding</i> an
engraver, who sold them to <i>Humphry</i> the printseller
near <i>Temple-Bar</i>, their present proprietor. How they
fell into the hands of the <i>Birmingham</i> manufacturer
(who took off a few impressions from them), is unknown.</p>

<p>Query. Does the plate engraved on both sides
contain the two modern designs?</p>

<p>In a Catalogue of Books sold by <i>W. Bathoe</i>, was
included "Part of the Collection of the late ingenious
<i>W. Hogarth</i>, Esq. Serjeant Painter to his Majesty;"
in which was <i>Beaver's</i> "<i>Roman</i> Military
Punishments," with <i>twelve plates</i> by <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p>The plate to Chap. XVII. viz. "Pay stopt wholly,
or in part, by way of punishment"&mdash;"Barley given
to offenders instead of wheat, &amp;c." differs in many
instances from that sold with the set. At the bottom
of the former, in the book, we read, "<i>W. Hogarth,
Invent. sculpt."</i> The latter has "<i>W. Hogarth, invent.
&amp; fec.</i>" The former has a range of tents behind
the pay-table. These are omitted in the latter;
which likewise exhibits an additional soldier attendant
on the measuring out of the corn, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the plate sold with the
set is spurious. Had it been a copy, it would naturally
have been a servile one. Some reason, now undiscoverable,
must have prevailed on our artist to
re-engrave it with variations.</p>

<p>N. B. The two "scenes of modern war," mentioned
also in p. <a href="#Page_134">134</a>, were designed for a continuation of
the same work, which was never printed, as I guess
from the conclusion of the Author's preface. "This
regularly divided my book into two parts; one
treating of the <i>Roman</i>, the other of the <i>Modern Military
Punishments</i>. The first I now send into the
world, as a man going into the water dips his foot
to feel what reception he is like to meet with; by
that rule resolving, either to publish the second
part, or sit down contented with the private satisfaction
of having, by my studies, rendered myself
more able worthily to discharge the duties of my
office."</p>

<p>I have since been assured, that our Author's heir
was a pastry-cook, who used all the copies of this
book for waste-paper.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>3. A burlesque on <i>Kent's</i> altar piece at <i>St. Clement's</i>,
with notes. "<i>It represents angels very ill drawn,
playing on various instruments.</i>" Speaking of this
print, Mr. <i>Walpole</i> in one place calls it a <i>parody</i>; and
in another, a <i>burlesque</i> on <i>Kent's</i> Altar-piece. But,
if we may believe <i>Hogarth</i> himself, it is neither, but
a very fair and honest representation of a despicable
performance. The following is our artist's inscription
to it, transcribed <i>verbatim &amp; literatim</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>This picture produced a tract, intituled, "A Letter
from a Parishioner of <i>St. Clement Danes</i> to <i>Edmund</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
<i>[Gibson]</i> Lord Bishop of <i>London</i>, occasion'd by
his lordship's causing the picture over the altar
to be taken down: with some observations on the
use and abuse of Church-paintings in general, and
of that picture in particular, 1725." 8vo. See <a href="#N_II_See_p_137">Appendix
II</a>. The proofs of this plate are commonly
on blue paper, though I have met with more than
one on white. The original, after it was removed
from the church, was for some years one of the ornaments
of the music-room at <i>The Crown and Anchor</i>
in the <i>Strand</i>. As this house has frequently changed
its tenants, &amp;c. I am unable to trace the picture in
question any further. There is a good copy of this
print by <i>Livesay</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>4. A scene in <i>Handel's</i> opera of <i>Ptolomeo</i>, performed
in 1728, with <i>Farinelli, Cuzzoni,</i> and <i>Senesino</i>, in
the characters of <i>Ptolemy, Cleopatra,</i> and <i>Julius Cæsar</i>.
Those who are inclined to doubt the authenticity of
this performance, will do well to consult the representation
on a painted canvas in the small print on
masquerades and operas, where the same figures occur
in almost the same attitudes. I do not, however,
vouch for the genuineness of this plate. In
<i>Southwark Fair</i>, our artist has borrowed the subject
of his show-cloth from <i>Laguerre</i>; and might, in the
present instance, have adopted it from another hand.</p>

<p>The appearance <i>Farinelli</i> makes on this occasion
may be justified by the following quotation from a
Pamphlet, intituled, <i>Reflections upon Theatrical Expression
in Tragedy, &amp;c.</i> printed for <i>W. Johnston</i>, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
1755. "I shall therefore, in my further remarks
upon this article, go back to the <i>Old Italian
Theatre</i>, when <i>Farinelli</i> drew every body to the
<i>Haymarket</i>. What a pipe! what modulation!
what extasy to the ear! But, heavens! what
clumsiness! what stupidity! what offence to the
eye! Reader, if of the city, thou mayest probably
have seen in the fields of <i>Islington</i> or <i>Mile-end</i>, or
if thou art in the environs of <i>St. James's</i>, thou
must have observed in the park, with what ease
and agility a Cow, heavy with Calf, has rose up
at the command of the Milk-woman's foot. Thus
from the mossy bank sprung up the <i>Divine Farinelli</i>.
Then with long strides advancing a few
paces, his left hand settled upon his hip, in a beautiful
bend like that of the handle of an old-fashioned
caudle-cup, his right remained immoveable
across his manly breast, till numbness called its
partner to supply its place; when it relieved itself
in the position of the other handle to the caudle-cup."
p. 63, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Under a copy of the print abovementioned, which
must have been made soon after its publication, appear
the following inscription, and wretched ungrammatical
lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>

<p>The characters in the print under consideration,
might have been new-christen'd by the copier of it.</p>

<p>Either the dignity of <i>Senesino</i> must have been wonderful,
or the following passage in Dr. <i>Warburton's</i>
"Enquiry into the Cause of Prodigies and Miracles,"
(printed in 1727) affords a most notorious example
of the Bathos. "Observe," says he, p. 60. "Sir
<i>Walter Raleigh's</i> great manner of ending the <i>first
part of the History of the World</i>. 'By this which
we have already set down is seen the beginning
and end of the Three first Monarchies of the
World; whereof the founders and erectors thought
that they could never have ended: that of <i>Rome</i>,
which made the fourth, was also at this time almost
at the highest. We have left it flourishing
in the middle of the field; have rooted up, or cut
down, all that kept it from the eyes and admiration
of the world; but after some continuance, it shall
begin to lose the beauty it had; the storms of ambition
shall beat her great boughs and branches
one against another; her leaves shall fall off; her
limbs wither, and a rabble of barbarous nations
enter the field and cut her down.' What strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>

by ropes from the Muses. Note, there are no Conjurors
concerned in it, as the Ignorant imagine.
The Bricks, Rubbish, &amp;c. will be real; but the
Excrements upon <i>Jack Hall</i> will be made of chewed
Gingerbread, to prevent Offence. <i>Vivat Rex. Price

I may add, that the <i>ropes</i> already mentioned are no
other than <i>halters</i>, suspended over the heads of the
three managers;<a name="FNanchor_3_125" id="FNanchor_3_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_125" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and that labels issuing from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
respective mouths have the following characteristic
words. The airy <i>Wilks</i>, who dangles the effigy of
<i>Punch</i>, is made to exclaim&mdash;"Poor <i>R-ch</i>! faith I
pitty him." The laureat <i>Cibber</i>, with <i>Harlequin</i> for
his playfellow, invokes the Muses painted on the cieling&mdash;"Assist,
ye sacred Nine;" while the solemn
<i>Booth</i>, letting down the image of <i>Jack Hall</i> into the
forica, is most tragically blaspheming&mdash;"Ha!
this will do, G-d d-m me." On a table before
these gentlemen lies a pamphlet, exhibiting a print
of <i>Jack Shepherd</i>, in confinement; and over the forica
is suspended a parcel of waste paper, consisting of
leaves torn from <i>The Way of the World&mdash;Hamlet&mdash;Macbeth</i>,
and <i>Julius Cæsar. Ben Jonson's</i> Ghost, in
the mean while, is rising through the stage, and
p&mdash;&mdash;g on a pantomimic statue tumbled from its
base. A fidler is also represented hanging by a cord
in the air, and performing, with a scroll before him,
that exhibits&mdash;<i>Music for the What</i>&mdash;[perhaps the
<i>What d' ye call it</i>] <i>entertainment</i>. The countenances
of Tragedy and Comedy, on each side of the stage, are
hoodwinked by the bills for <i>Harlequin Dr. Faustus</i>
and <i>Harlequin Shepherd</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. There is also a
dragon preparing to fly; a dog thrusting his head
out of his kennel; a flask put in motion by machinery,
&amp;c. <i>Vivetur Ingenio</i> is the motto over the
curtain. In Mr. <i>Walpole's</i> catalogue the description
of this plate is, "<i>Booth, Wilks, and Cibber, contriving

<h4>1726.</h4>


<p>1. Frontispiece to <i>Terræ-filius. W. Hogarth fec.</i>
This work was printed in two volumes 12°, at <i>Oxford</i>,
and is a satire on the Tory principles of that
University. It was written by <i>Nicholas Amherst</i>,
author of <i>The Craftsman</i>, and was originally published
in one volume.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>2. Twelve prints for <i>Hudibras</i>; the large set. <i>W.
Hogarth inv. pinx. et sculp.</i> Under the head of <i>Butler</i>:
"The basso relievo of the pedestal represents the
general design of Mr. <i>Butler</i>, in his incomparable
poem of <i>Hudibras</i>; viz. <i>Butler's</i> Genious in a Car
lashing around Mount <i>Parnassus</i>, in the persons of
<i>Hudibras</i> and <i>Ralpho</i>, Rebellion, Hypocrisy, and
Ignorance, the reigning vices of his time." This
set of prints was published by subscription, by <i>P.
Overton</i> and <i>J. Cooper</i>. Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i> has seven of
the original drawings; three others are known to be
preserved in <i>Holland</i>; and two more were lately existing
in this kingdom. The plates, as has been mentioned
already in p. <a href="#Page_11">11</a>, are now the property of Mr.
<i>Sayer</i>, whose name, as publisher, is subjoined. The
Rev. Mr. <i>Bowle</i>, F. A. S. had a set with the list of
the subscribers, which he purchased at the Duke of
<i>Beaufort's</i> sale in <i>Wiltshire</i>. The printed title to
them is, "Twelve excellent and most diverting
Prints; taken from the celebrated Poem of <i>Hudibras</i>,
wrote by Mr. <i>Samuel Butler</i>. Exposing the
Villany and Hypocrisy of the Times. Invented
and Engraved on Twelve Copper-plates, by <i>William</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<i>Hogarth</i>, and are humbly dedicated to <i>William
Ward</i>, Esq. of <i>Great Houghton</i> in <i>Northamptonshire</i>;
and Mr. <i>Allan Ramsay</i>, of <i>Edinburgh</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"What excellence can Brass or Marble claim!<br />
These Papers better do secure thy Fame:<br />
Thy Verse all Monuments does far surpass,<br />
No Mausoleum's like thy <i>Hudibras</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Printed and sold by <i>Philip Overton</i>, Print and
Map-seller, at the <i>Golden Buck</i> near <i>St. Dunstan's
Church</i> in <i>Fleet-street</i>; and <i>John Cooper</i>, in <i>James-street,
Covent Garden</i>, 1726."</p>

<p><i>Allan Ramsay</i> subscribed for 30 sets. The number
of subscribers in all amounts to 192. On the print
of <i>Hudibras</i> and the <i>Lawyer</i> is <i>W. Hogart delin. et
sculp.</i> a proof that our artist had not yet disused the
original mode in which he spelt his name. In the
scene of the <i>Committee</i>, one of the members has his
gloves on his head. I am told this whimsical custom
once prevailed among our sanctified fraternity; but it
is in vain, I suppose, to ask the reason why. In plate
XI. (earliest impressions) the words "Down with
the Rumps" are wanting on the scroll.&mdash;Memorandum.
At the top of the proposals for this set of
Prints, is a small one representing <i>Hudibras</i> and
<i>Ralpho</i>, engraved by <i>Pine</i>. The original drawing
for it by <i>Hogarth</i> is in the possession of Mr. <i>Betew</i>,
Silversmith, in <i>Compton-street, Soho</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>3. Seventeen small prints for <i>Hudibras</i>, with <i>Butler's</i>
head. There certainly must have been some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
mistake concerning this portrait. It never could
have been designed for the author of <i>Hudibras</i>; but
more strongly resembles <i>John Baptist Monnoyer</i>, the
flower-painter. There is a print of him by <i>White</i>,
from a picture of Sir <i>Godfrey Kneller</i>. This I suppose
to have been the original of <i>Hogarth's</i> small
<i>Butler</i>.</p>

<p>The same designs engraved on a larger scale, and
with some slight variations, by <i>J. Mynde</i>, for <i>Grey's</i>
edition of <i>Hudibras</i>, published in 1744.</p>

<p>Previous, however, to both, appeared another set of
plates, eighteen in number, for an edition in <i>eighteens</i>
of this celebrated poem. To these it is manifest that
<i>Hogarth</i> was indebted for his ideas of several of the
scenes and personages both in his larger and smaller
performances on the same subject. That the collector
may know the book when he meets with it,
the following is a transcript of the title-page. "<i>Hudibras.</i>
In three Parts. Written in the time of
the late Wars. Corrected and amended, with
Additions. To which is added, Annotations to
the third Part, with an exact Index to the whole;
never before printed. Adorned with cuts. London.
Printed for <i>R. Chiswel, J. Tonson, T. Horne,</i>
and <i>R. Willington</i>, 1710."</p>

<p>Copies from the smaller plates are likewise inserted
in <i>Townly's</i> translation of <i>Hudibras</i> into <i>French</i>, with
the <i>English</i> on the opposite page. He was, I believe,
an officer in the <i>Irish</i> brigade. The following is the
title-page to his work. "<i>Hudibras</i>, Poeme ecrit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
dans les tems des troubles d'<i>Angleterre</i>; et traduit
en vers <i>François</i>, avec des remarques et des figures.
3 tom. 12mo. A <i>Londres</i>, 1757." It seems rather
to have been printed at <i>Paris</i>. The plates have
no name subscribed to them.<br />

<p>4. <i>Cunicularii</i>, or the Wise Men of <i>Godliman</i> in
Consultation.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"They held their talents most adroit<br />
For any mystical exploit."  <span class="smcap">Hudib.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This print was published in the year 1726, i. e. about
the same time that Lord <i>Onslow</i> wrote the following
letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To the Hon<sup>ble</sup>. Sir <i>Hans Sloane</i>. To be left
at the <i>Grecian</i> Coffe House, in <i>Devereux
Court</i> near <i>Temple Bar London</i>.</p>

<p>"Sir, The report of a woman's breeding of rabbits
has almost alarmed <i>England</i>, and in a manner
persuaded several people of sound judg<sup>t</sup> of that
truth. I have been at some pains to discover the

you will se by the Depotition taken before me,
which shall be published in a day or two. I am</p>

<p>"Y<sup>r</sup> humble Servant,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Onslow.</span></p>

<p>"<i>Clandon, Dec.</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1726."</p></blockquote>

<p>Soon after, Mr. <i>St. André</i> also addressed this note
to Sir <i>Hans Sloane</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sir, I have brought the woman from <i>Guilford</i>
to y<sup>e</sup> Bagnio in <i>Leicester-fields</i>, where you may if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>

<p>"To Sir <i>Hans Sloane</i> in
<i>Bloomsbury Square</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the plate already mentioned, figure A represents
<i>St. André</i>. [He has a kitt under his arm, having
been at first designed by his family for a fencing and
dancing-master, though he afterwards attached himself
to music of a higher order than that necessary
for one of the professions already mentioned.] B is
Sir <i>Richard Manningham</i>, C Mr. <i>Sainthill</i> a celebrated
surgeon here in <i>London</i>, D is <i>Howard</i> the surgeon
at <i>Guildford</i>, who was supposed to have had a
chief hand in the imposture. The rest of the characters
explain themselves.</p>

<p>Perhaps my readers may excuse me, if I add a
short account of another design for a print on the
same subject; especially as some collectors have
been willing to receive it as a work of <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Mist's Weekly Journal, Saturday, Jan.</i> 11th,
1726-7, was the following advertisement:</p>

<p>"The Rabbit affair made clear in a full account
of the whole matter; with the pictures engraved
of the pretended Rabbit-breeder herself, <i>Mary
Tofts</i>, and of the Rabbits, and of the persons who
attended her during her pretended deliveries,
shewing who were and who were not imposed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
by her. 'Tis given gratis no where, but only up
one pair of stairs at the sign of the celebrated
Anodyne Necklace recommended by Doctor <i>Chamberlen</i>
for Children's teeth, &amp;c."</p>

<p>The original drawing from which the plate promised
in <i>Mist's</i> Journal was taken, remained in the
possession of Mr. <i>James Vertue</i>, and was probably designed
by his brother <i>George</i>. It was sold in 1781
in the collection of <i>George Scott</i>, Esq. of <i>Chigwell</i> in
<i>Essex</i>, together with eight tracts relative to the same
imposture, for three guineas, and is now in the collection
of Mr. <i>Gough</i>.</p>

<p><i>St. André's Miscarriage</i>, a ballad, published in
1727, has the following stanza on this subject:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"He dissected, compar'd, and distinguish'd likewise<br />
The make of these rabbits, their growth and their size.<br />
He preserv'd them in spirits, and&mdash;a little too late<br />
Preserv'd (<i>Vertue sculpsit</i>) a neat copper plate."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>There is also a copper-plate, consisting of twelve
compartments, on the same story. It exhibits every
stage throughout this celebrated fraud. <i>St. André</i>
appears in the habit of a <i>Merry-Andrew</i>. The general
title of it is, "The Doctors in Labour; or a
new Whim-wham from <i>Guilford</i>. Being a representation
of the frauds by which the <i>Godliman</i> woman
carried on her pretended Rabbit breeding;
also of the simplicity of our Doctors, by which
they assisted to carry on that imposture, discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
their skill, and contributed to the mirth of his
Majesty's liege subjects."</p>

<p>In <i>Mist's</i> Journal for <i>Saturday, Dec.</i> 17, 1726, is
also the following paragraph, which shews that the
playhouse joined in the general ridicule of <i>St. André</i>.
"Last week the entertainment called <i>The Necromancer</i>
was performed at the Theatre in <i>Lincoln's-Inn
Fields</i>, wherein a new <i>Rabbit-scene</i> was introduced
by way of episode; by which the Public
may understand as much of that affair, as by the
present controversy among the Gentlemen of the
faculty, who are flinging their bitter pills at one
another, to convince the world that none of them
understand any thing of the matter." I am told
by one of the spectators still alive, that in this new
scene, <i>Harlequin</i>, being converted into a woman,
pretended to be in labour, and was first delivered of
a large pig, then of a sooterkin, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>From the same paper of <i>Saturday, Jan.</i> 21, 1727,
we learn, that "The pretended Rabbit-breeder, in
order to perpetuate her fame, has had her picture
done in a curious mezzotinto print by an able
hand." It was painted by <i>Laguerre</i>, and scraped
by <i>Faber</i>. She has a rabbit on her lap, and displays
a countenance expressive of the utmost vulgarity.
In <i>Hogarth's</i> comic representation, the remarkable
turn-up of the nose is preserved. This, perhaps,
was the only feature in her face that could not be
altered by the convulsions of her pretended agony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
or our artist would have given her resemblance with
greater exactness.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Dillingham</i>, an apothecary in <i>Red-Lion-Square</i>,
laid a wager of ten guineas with <i>St. André</i>, that in a
limited time the cheat would be detected. The
money was paid him, and he expended it on a piece
of plate, with three rabbits engraved by way of
arms.</p>

<p>I learn from <i>The Weekly Miscellany</i>, for <i>April</i> 19,
1740, that a few days before, "The celebrated
Rabbit-woman of <i>Godalmin</i> in <i>Surry</i> was committed
to <i>Guildford Gaol</i>, for receiving stolen goods."</p>

<p>In <i>The Gazetteer, or Daily London Advertiser, Jan.</i>
21, 1763, was this paragraph, which closes the story
of our heroine: "Last week died at <i>Godalming</i> in
<i>Surry, Mary Tofts,</i> formerly noted for an imposition
of breeding Rabbits."</p>

<p>1. Music introduced to <i>Apollo</i> by <i>Minerva. Hogarth

unquestionable authority, that this print is a mere
copy from the frontispiece to a more ancient book of

<i>in this print.</i>" The attentive observer will find, that
<i>Hogarth</i> has transplanted several circumstances from
hence into the first plate to the <i>Analysis of Beauty</i>, as
well as into his Satire on the Methodists. See the ornaments
of an altar composed of a concatenation of
different periwigs, and the barometers expressing the
different degrees of animal heat. At the corners of
the dial on the top of this print is the date of the
year (1727), and the face of <i>Heidegger</i> appears under
the figure XII. In the earliest impressions, the word
Provocatives has, instead of V the open vowel U.

<p>Concerning <i>John James Heidegger</i>, whose face has
been more than once introduced by our artist, the
reader may express some curiosity. The following
account of him is therefore appended to the foregoing
article.</p>

<p>"This extraordinary man, the son of a clergyman,
was a native of <i>Zurich</i> in <i>Switzerland</i>, where he
married, but left his country in consequence of an
intrigue. Having had an opportunity of visiting
the principal cities of <i>Europe</i>, he acquired a taste
for elegant and refined pleasures, which, united to
a strong inclination for voluptuousness, by degrees
qualified him for the management of public
amusements. In 1708, when he was near 50 years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
old, he came to <i>England</i> on a negotiation from the
<i>Swiss</i> at <i>Zurich</i>; but, failing in his embassy, he
entered as a private soldier in the guards for protection.<a name="FNanchor_2_128" id="FNanchor_2_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_128" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
By his sprightly, engaging conversation,
and insinuating address, he soon worked himself
into the good graces of our young people of fashion;
from whom he obtained the appellation of 'the
<i>Swiss</i> Count.'<a name="FNanchor_3_129" id="FNanchor_3_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_129" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He had the address to procure a
subscription, with which in 1709 he was enabled
to furnish out the opera of '<i>Thomyris</i>,'<a name="FNanchor_4_130" id="FNanchor_4_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_130" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which
was written in <i>English</i>, and performed at the Queen's
theatre in the <i>Haymarket</i>. The music, however,
was <i>Italian</i>; that is to say, airs selected from sundry
of the foreign operas by <i>Bononcini, Scarlatti,
Stefani, Gasparini,</i> and <i>Albinoni</i>. Most of the songs
in '<i>Thomyris</i>' were excellent, those by <i>Bononcini</i>
especially: <i>Valentini, Margarita,</i> and Mrs. <i>Tofts</i>
sung in it; and <i>Heidegger</i> by this performance
alone was a gainer of 500 guineas.<a name="FNanchor_5_131" id="FNanchor_5_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_131" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The judicious
remarks he made on several defects in the
conduct of our operas in general, and the hints
he threw out for improving the entertainments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the royal theatre, soon established his character as
a good critic. Appeals were made to his judgement;
and some very magnificent and elegant decorations,
introduced upon the stage in consequence
of his advice, gave such satisfaction to
<i>George</i> II. who was fond of operas, that, upon being
informed to whose genius he was indebted for
these improvements, his majesty was pleased from
that time to countenance him, and he soon obtained
the chief management of the Opera-house in <i>The
Haymarket</i>. He then set about improving another
species of diversion, not less agreeable to the king,
which was the masquerades, and over these he always
presided at the king's theatre. He was likewise
appointed master of the revels. The nobility
now caressed him so much, and had such an opinion
of his taste, that all splendid and elegant entertainments
given by them upon particular occasions,
and all private assemblies by subscription,
were submitted to his direction.<a name="FNanchor_6_132" id="FNanchor_6_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_132" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>"From the emoluments of these several employments,
he gained a regular considerable income,
amounting, it is said, in some years, to 5000 <i>l.</i>
which he spent with much liberality: particularly
in the maintenance of perhaps a somewhat too luxurious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
table; so that it may be said, he raised an
income, but never a fortune. His foibles, however,
if they deserve so harsh a name, were completely
'covered' by his 'charity,' which was
boundless.<a name="FNanchor_7_133" id="FNanchor_7_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_133" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>"That he was a good judge of music, appears
from his opera: but this is all that is known of
his mental abilities;<a name="FNanchor_8_134" id="FNanchor_8_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_134" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> unless we add, what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
have good authority for saying in honour to his
<i>memory</i>, that he walked from <i>Charing-Cross</i> to <i>Temple-bar</i>,
and back again; and when he came home,
wrote down every sign on each side the <i>Strand</i>.</p>

<p>"As to his person, though he was tall and well
made, it was not very pleasing, from an unusual
hardness of features.<a name="FNanchor_9_135" id="FNanchor_9_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_135" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But he was the first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
joke upon his own ugliness; and he once laid a
wager with the earl of <i>Chesterfield</i>, that, within a
certain given time, his lordship would not be able
to produce so hideous a face in all <i>London</i>. After
strict search, a woman was found, whose features
were at first sight thought stronger than <i>Heidegger's</i>;
but, upon clapping her head-dress upon himself,
he was universally allowed to have won the wager.
<i>Jolly</i>, a well-known taylor, carrying his bill to a
noble duke, his grace, for evasion said, 'Damn
your ugly face, I never will pay you till you bring
me an uglier fellow than yourself!' <i>Jolly</i> bowed
and retired, wrote a letter, and sent it by a servant
to <i>Heidegger</i>; saying, 'his grace wished to see him
the next morning on particular business.' <i>Heidegger</i>
attended, and <i>Jolly</i> was there to meet him;
and in consequence, as soon as <i>Heidegger's</i> visit was
over, <i>Jolly</i> received the cash.</p>

<p>"The late facetious duke of <i>Montagu</i> (the memorable
author of the bottle-conjuror at the theatre
in <i>The Haymarket</i>) gave an entertainment at <i>The
Devil-tavern, Temple-bar</i>, to several of the nobility
and gentry, selecting the most convivial, and a
few hard-drinkers, who were all in the plot.
<i>Heidegger</i> was invited, and in a few hours after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
dinner was made so dead drunk that he was
carried out of the room, and laid insensible upon
a bed. A profound sleep ensued; when the late
Mrs. <i>Salmon's</i> daughter was introduced, who took
a mould from his face in plaster of Paris. From
this a mask was made, and a few days before the
next masquerade (at which the king promised to
be present, with the countess of <i>Yarmouth</i>), the
duke made application to <i>Heidegger's</i> valet de
chambre, to know what suit of cloaths he was
likely to wear; and then procuring a similar
dress, and a person of the same stature, he gave
him his instructions. On the evening of the
masquerade, as soon as his majesty was seated
(who was always known by the conductor of the
entertainment and the officers of the court, though
concealed by his dress from the company), <i>Heidegger</i>,
as usual, ordered the music to play 'God
save the King;' but his back was no sooner turned,
than the false <i>Heidegger</i> ordered them to strike up
'<i>Charly</i> over the Water.' The whole company
were instantly thunderstruck, and all the courtiers,
not in the plot, were thrown into a stupid consternation.
<i>Heidegger</i> flew to the music-gallery, swore,
stamped, and raved, accused the musicians of
drunkenness, or of being set on by some secret
enemy to ruin him. The king and the countess
laughed so immoderately, that they hazarded a
discovery. While <i>Heidegger</i> stayed in the gallery,
'God save the King' was the tune; but when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
after setting matters to rights, he retired to one of
the dancing-rooms, to observe if decorum was
kept by the company, the counterfeit stepping
forward, and placing himself upon the floor of the
theatre, just in front of the music-gallery, called
out in a most audible voice, imitating <i>Heidegger</i>,
damned them for blockheads, had he not just
told them to play '<i>Charly</i> over the Water.' A
pause ensued; the musicians, who knew his character,
in their turn thought him either drunk or
mad; but, as he continued his vociferation,
'<i>Charly</i>' was played again. At this repetition of
the supposed affront, some of the officers of the
guards, who always attended upon these occasions,
were for ascending the gallery, and kicking the
musicians out; but the late duke of <i>Cumberland</i>,
who could hardly contain himself, interposed.
The company were thrown into great confusion.
'Shame! Shame!' resounded from all parts, and
<i>Heidegger</i> once more flew in a violent rage to that
part of the theatre facing the gallery. Here the
duke of <i>Montagu</i>, artfully addressing himself to
him, told him, 'the king was in a violent passion;
that his best way was to go instantly and make an
apology, for certainly the music were mad, and
afterwards to discharge them.' Almost at the
same instant, he ordered the false <i>Heidegger</i> to do
the same. The scene now became truly comic in
the circle before the king. <i>Heidegger</i> had no
sooner made a genteel apology for the insolence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
his musicians, but the false <i>Heidegger</i> advanced,
and, in a plaintive tone, cried out, 'Indeed, Sire,
it was not my fault, but that devil's in my likeness.'
Poor <i>Heidegger</i> turned round, stared, staggered,
grew pale, and could not utter a word. The duke
then humanely whispered in his ear the sum of his
plot, and the counterfeit was ordered to take off
his mask. Here ended the frolick; but <i>Heidegger</i>
swore he would never attend any public amusement,
if that witch the wax-work woman did not
break the mould, and melt down the mask before
his face.<a name="FNanchor_10_136" id="FNanchor_10_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_136" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"Being once at supper with a large company,
when a question was debated, which nationalist of
<i>Europe</i>, had the greatest ingenuity; to the surprise
of all present, he claimed that character for the
<i>Swiss</i>, and appealed to himself for the truth of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
'I was born a <i>Swiss</i>, said he, 'and came to <i>England</i>
without a farthing, where I have found means
to gain 5000 <i>l.</i> a year, and to spend it. Now I
defy the most able <i>Englishman</i> to go to <i>Switzerland</i>,
and either to gain that income, or to spend it there.'
He died <i>Sept.</i> 4, 1749, at the advanced age of 96
years, at his house at <i>Richmond</i> in <i>Surrey</i>, where he
was buried. He left behind him one natural
daughter, Miss <i>Pappet</i>, who was married <i>Sept.</i> 2,
1750, to Captain (afterwards Sir <i>Peter) Denis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_137" id="FNanchor_11_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_137" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Part of this lady's fortune was a house at the north
west corner of <i>Queen-square, Ormond-street</i>, which
Sir <i>Peter</i> afterwards sold to the late Dr. <i>Campbell</i>,
and purchased a seat in <i>Kent</i>, pleasantly situated
near <i>Westram</i>, then called <i>Valence</i>, but now (by its
present proprietor, the earl of <i>Hillsborough</i>) <i>Hill
Park</i>."</p>

to Count <i>Heidegger</i>," (which is the production of Mr. <i>Fielding</i>,
though foisted into the works of Dr. <i>Arbuthnot</i>,) the facetious
writer says, "I cannot help congratulating you on
that gift of Nature, by which you seem so adapted to the
post you enjoy. I mean that natural masque, which is too
visible a perfection to be here insisted on&mdash;&mdash;and, I am
sure, never fails of making an impression on the most indifferent
beholder. Another gift of Nature, which you seem
to enjoy in no small degree, is that modest confidence supporting
you in every act of your life. Certainly, a great
blessing! For I always have observed, that brass in the
forehead draws gold into the pocket. As for what mankind
calls virtues, I shall not compliment you on them:
since you are so wise as to keep them secret from the world,
far be it from me to publish them; especially since they are
things which lie out of the way of your calling. Smile then

<p>The date of the print before us has been conjectured
from its reference to the <i>Beggar's Opera</i>,
and <i>Perseus</i> and <i>Andromeda</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_138" id="FNanchor_1_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_138" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> both of which were
acted in the year already mentioned.</p>

<p>This plate represents the removal of <i>Rich</i> and
his scenery, authors, actors, &amp;c. from <i>Lincoln's-Inn
Fields</i> to the <i>New House</i>; and might therefore be
as probably referred to the year 1733, when that
event happened. The scene is the area of <i>Covent
Garden</i>, across which, leading toward the door of the
Theatre, is a long procession, consisting of a cart
loaded with thunder and lightning; performers, &amp;c.
and at the head of them Mr. <i>Rich</i> (invested with the
skin of the famous dog in <i>Perseus</i> and <i>Andromeda</i>)
riding with his mistress in a chariot driven by <i>Harlequin</i>,
and drawn by Satyrs. But let the verses at
bottom explain our artist's meaning:</p>

<p>By the <i>Man of Taste</i>, Mr. <i>Pope</i> was apparently
designed. He is represented, in his tye-wig, at one
corner of the <i>Piazza</i>, wiping his posteriors with the
<i>Beggar's Opera</i>. The letter P is over his head. His
little sword is significantly placed, and the peculiarity
of his figure well preserved.</p>

<p>The reason why our artist has assigned such an
employment to him, we can only guess. It seems,
indeed, from Dr. <i>Johnson's</i> Life of <i>Gay</i>, that <i>Pope</i> did
not <i>think</i> the <i>Beggar's Opera</i> would succeed. <i>Swift</i>,
however, was of the same opinion; and yet the
former supported the piece on the first night of exhibition,
and the latter defended it in his <i>Intelligencer</i>
against the attacks of Dr. <i>Herring</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_144" id="FNanchor_7_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_144" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> then preacher to

of <i>Canterbury. Hogarth</i> might be wanton in his satire;
might have founded it on idle report; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
might have sacrificed truth to the prejudices of Sir
<i>James Thornhill</i>, whose quarrel, on another occasion,
he is supposed to have taken up, when he ridiculed
<i>The Translator of Homer</i> in a view of "The Gate
of <i>Burlington-house</i>."</p>

<p>There are besides some allusions in the verses already
quoted, as well as in the piece they refer to,
which I confess my inability to illustrate. Those
who are best acquainted with the theatric and poetical
history of the years 1728, &amp;c. would prove the
most successful commentators on the present occasion;
but not many can possibly be now alive who
were at that period competent judges of such
matters.</p>

<p>This print, however, was not only unpublished,
but in several places is unfinished. It was probably
suppressed by the influence of some of the characters
represented in it. The style of composition, and
manner of engraving, &amp;c. &amp;c. would have sufficiently
proved it to be the work of <i>Hogarth</i>, if the initials
of his name had been wanting at the bottom of the
plate.</p>

<p>No painter or engraver's name. The plate seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
at once to represent the exhibition of <i>The Beggar's
Opera</i>, and the rehearsal of an <i>Italian</i> one. In the
<i>former</i>, all the characters are drawn with the heads
of different animals; as <i>Polly</i>, with a Cat's; <i>Lucy</i>,
with a Sow's; <i>Macheath</i>, with an Ass's; <i>Lockit</i>, and
Mr. and Mrs. <i>Peachum</i>, with those of an Ox, a Dog,
and an Owl. In the <i>latter</i>, several noblemen appear
conducting the chief female singer forward on the
stage, and perhaps are offering her money, or protection
from a figure that is rushing towards her with
a drawn sword. Harmony, flying in the air, turns
her back on the <i>English</i> playhouse, and hastens toward
the rival theatre. Musicians stand in front of
the former, playing on the Jew's-harp, the salt-box,
the bladder and string, bagpipes, &amp;c. On one side
are people of distinction, some of whom kneel as if
making an offer to <i>Polly</i>, or paying their adorations to
her. To these are opposed a butcher, &amp;c. expressing
similar applause. <i>Apollo</i>, and one of the Muses, are
fast asleep beneath the stage. A man is easing nature
under a wall hung with ballads, and shewing his
contempt of such compositions, by the use he makes
of one of them. A sign of the star, a gibbet, and
some other circumstances less intelligible, appear in
the back ground.<br />

idea of it is borrowed from a <i>French</i> book, called
<i>Les Chats</i>, printed at <i>Amsterdam</i> in 1728. In this
work, facing p. 117, is represented an opera performed
by cats, superbly habited. The design is by
<i>Coypel</i>; the engraving by <i>T. Otten</i>. At the end of
the treatise, the opera itself is published. It is improbable
that <i>Hogarth</i> should have met with this <i>jeu
d'esprit</i>; and, if he did, he could not have read the
explanation to it.</p>

both of the lady and <i>Percy</i>, are totally unlike their

verses by <i>Allan Ramsay</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Here struts old pious <i>Harry</i>, once the great<br />
Reformer of the <i>English</i> church and state:<br />
'Twas thus he stood, when <i>Anna Bullen's</i> charms<br />

With his right hand he leads her as his own,<br />
To place this matchless beauty on his throne;<br />
Whilst <i>Kate</i> and <i>Piercy</i> mourn their wretched fate,<br />
And view the royal pair with equal hate,<br />
Reflecting on the pomp of glittering crowns,<br />

<p>3. A half-starved boy. (The same as is represented
in the print of <i>Morning</i>.) <i>W. H. pinx. F.

This print bears the date of 1730; but I suspect the
0 was designed for an 8, and that the upper part of it is
wanting, because the aqua fortis failed; or, that the
pupil copied the figure from a sketch of his master,
which at that time was unappropriated. No one will
easily suspect <i>Hogarth</i> of such plagiarism as he might
justly be charged with, could he afterwards have
adopted this complete design as his own; neither is
it probable that any youth could have produced a
figure so characteristic as this; or, if he could, that
he should have published it without any concomitant
circumstances to explain its meaning. The above
title, which some collector has bestowed on this
etching, is not of a discriminative kind. Who can
tell from it whether he is to look for a boy emaciated
by hunger, or shivering with cold? It is mentioned
here, only that it may be reprobated. If every
young practitioner's imitation of a single figure by
<i>Hogarth</i> were to be admitted among his works, they
would never be complete.<br />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_152" id="Footnote_1_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_152"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> On <i>Sunday</i> morning, the 4th of <i>February</i>, Mrs. <i>Lydia
Duncombe</i>, aged 80, <i>Elizabeth Harrison</i>, her companion, aged
60, were found strangled, and <i>Ann Price</i>, her maid, aged 17,
with her throat cut, in their beds, at the said Mrs. <i>Duncombe's</i>
apartments in <i>Tanfield-Court</i> in <i>The Temple. Sarah Malcolm</i>, a
chare-woman, was apprehended the same evening on the information
of Mr. <i>Kerrol</i>, who had chambers on the same stair-case,
and had found some bloody linen under his bed, and a
silver tankard in his close-stool, which she had hid there. She
made a pretended confession, and gave information against
<i>Thomas Alexander, James Alexander,</i> and <i>Mary Tracey,</i> that they
committed the murder and robbery, and she only stood on the
stairs as a watch; that they took away three hundred pounds
and some valuable goods, of which she had not more than her
share; but the coroner's inquest gave their verdict <i>Wilful Murder</i>
against <i>Malcolm</i> only.&mdash;On the 23d her trial came on at
<i>The Old Bailey</i>: when it appeared that Mrs. <i>Duncombe</i> had but
54 <i>l.</i> in her box, and 53 <i>l.</i> 11 <i>s.</i> 6 <i>d.</i> of it were found upon <i>Malcolm</i>
betwixt her cap and hair. She owned her being concerned
in the robbery, but denied she knew any thing of the
murder till she went in with other company to see the deceased.
The jury found her guilty of both. She was strongly
suspected to have been concerned in the murder of Mr. <i>Nesbit</i>
in 1729, near <i>Drury-lane</i>, for which one <i>Kelly</i>, alias <i>Owen</i>,
was hanged; the grounds for his conviction being only a
bloody razor found under the murdered man's head that was
known to be his. But he denied to the last his being concerned
in the murder; and said, in his defence, he lent the razor to
a woman he did not know.&mdash;On <i>Wednesday, March</i> 7, she was
executed on a gibbet opposite <i>Mitre-court, Fleet-street</i>, where
the crowd was so great, that a Mrs. <i>Strangways</i>, who lived in
<i>Fleet-street</i>, near <i>Serjeant's-Inn</i>, crossed the street, from her
own house to Mrs. <i>Coulthurst's</i> on the opposite side of the way,
over the heads and shoulders of the mob. She went to execution
neatly dressed in a crape mourning gown, holding up
her head in the cart with an air, and looking as if she was
painted, which some did not scruple to affirm. Her corpse
was carried to an undertaker's upon <i>Snow-hill</i>, where multitudes
of people resorted, and gave money to see it: among
the rest a gentleman in deep mourning, who kissed her, and
gave the people half a crown. She was attended by the Rev.
Mr. <i>Pedington</i>, lecturer of <i>St. Bartholomew</i> the Great, seemed
penitent, and desired to see her master <i>Kerrol</i>; but, as she did
not, protested all accusations against him were false. During
her imprisonment she received a letter from her father at
<i>Dublin</i>, who was in too bad circumstances to send her such a
sum as 17 <i>l.</i> which she pretended he did. The night before
her execution, she delivered a paper to Mr. <i>Pedington</i> (the copy
of which he sold for 20 <i>l.</i>), of which the substance is printed in
<i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1733, p. 137. She had given much
the same account before, at her trial, in a long and fluent
speech.</p></div>

Duke of <i>Chandos's</i> coach. "<i>A satire on</i> Pope's
<i>Epistle on Taste. No name.</i>" It has been already
observed that the plate was suppressed; and if this
be true, the suppression may be accounted for from
the following inscription, lately met with at the back
of one of the copies.</p>

<p>"Bo<sup>t</sup> this book of Mr. <i>Wayte</i>, at <i>The Fountain
Tavern</i>, in <i>The Strand</i>, in the presence of Mr.
<i>Draper</i>, who told me he had it of the Printer,
Mr. <i>W. Rayner.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_160" id="FNanchor_1_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_160" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"J. Cosins."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>On this attested memorandum a prosecution seems
meant to have been founded. <i>Cosins</i> was an attorney,
and <i>Pope</i> was desirous on all occasions to make the
law the engine of his revenge.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_160" id="Footnote_1_160"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_160"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>Rayner</i> was at that time already under prosecution for
publishing a pamphlet called, "<i>Robin's</i> Game, or Seven's
the Main." Neglecting to surrender himself, he was taken
by a writ of execution from the crown, and confined to the
<i>King's Bench</i>; where he became connected with Lady <i>Dinely</i>,
whole character was of equal infamy with his own.</p><br /></div>


<p>7. The same, in a smaller size; prefixed to a
pamphlet, intituled, "A Miscellany of Taste, by
Mr. <i>Pope</i>," &amp;c. containing his Epistles, with
Notes and other poems. In the former of these Mr.
<i>Pope</i> has a tie-wig on, in the latter a cap.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>8. The same, in a size still smaller; very coarsely
engraved. Only one of them is noted by Mr. <i>Walpole</i>.</p>

<p>A reader of these Anecdotes observes, "That the
total silence of <i>Pope</i> concerning so great an artist,
encourages a suspicion that his attacks were felt
though not resented. The thunders of the poet
were usually pointed at inglorious adversaries;
but he might be conscious of a more equal match
in our formidable caricaturist. All ranks of people
have eyes for pencil'd ridicule, but of written
satire we have fewer judges. It may be suspected,
that the 'pictured shape' would never have
been complained of, had it been produced only
by a bungler in his art. But from the powers of
<i>Hogarth, Pope</i> seems to have apprehended more
lasting inconvenience; and the event has justified
his fear. The frontispiece to <i>Smedley's Gulliveriana</i>
has been long forgotten; but the <i>Gate of</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
<i>Burlington house</i> is an object coveted by all who
assemble prints of humour.&mdash;It may be added,
that our painter's reputation was at the height
ten years before the death of <i>Pope</i>, who could
not therefore have overlooked his merit, though,
for some reason or other, he has forborne to introduce
the slightest allusion to him or his performances.
Yet these, or copies from them, were
to be met with in almost every public and private
house throughout the kingdom; nor was it easy
for the bard of <i>Twickenham</i> to have mixed in
the conversation of the times, without being obliged
to hear repeated praises of the author of
<i>The Harlot's Progress</i>."</p>

<p>The sheet containing this page having been shewn
to a friend, produced from him the following remark:
"That <i>Pope</i> was silent on the merits of
<i>Hogarth</i> (as one of your readers has observed)
should excite little astonishment, as our artist's
print on the <i>South Sea</i> exhibits the translator of
<i>Homer</i> in no very flattering point of view. He is
represented with one of his hands in the pocket of
a fat personage, who wears a hornbook at his girdle.
For whom this figure was designed, is doubtful.
Perhaps it was meant for <i>Gay</i>, who was a fat
man, and a loser in the same scheme."&mdash;"<i>Gay</i>,"
says Dr. <i>Johnson</i>, "in that disastrous year had a
present from young <i>Craggs</i> of some <i>South-sea</i> stock,
and once supposed himself to be master of twenty-thousand
pounds. His friends persuaded him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
sell his share; but he dreamed of dignity and
splendour, and could not bear to obstruct his own
fortune. He was then importuned to sell as much
as would purchase an hundred a year for life,
which, says <i>Fenton</i>, will make you sure of a clean
shirt and a shoulder of mutton every day. This
counsel was rejected; the profit and principal
were lost, and <i>Gay</i> sunk under the calamity so low
that his life became in danger.&mdash;The Hornbook
appended to his girdle, perhaps, refers to the Fables
he wrote for the Duke of <i>Cumberland</i>. Some of
your ingenious correspondents, or Mr. <i>Walpole</i>,
who is <i>instar omnium</i>, may be able to give a further
illustration. The conclusion to the inscription
under this plate&mdash;<i>Guess at the rest, you'll find out
more</i>&mdash;seems also to imply a consciousness of such
personal satire as it was not prudent to explain. I
may add, that the print before us exhibits more
than one figure copied from <i>Callot</i>. Among the
people going along the gallery to raffle for husbands,
the curious observer will recognize the <i>Old Maid</i>
with lappets flying, &amp;c. afterwards introduced into
the scene of <i>Morning</i>. Dr. <i>Johnson</i>, however, bears
witness to the propriety of our great poet's introduction
into a satire on the 'disastrous year of national
infatuation, when more riches than <i>Peru</i>
can boast were expected from the <i>South Sea</i>; when
the contagion of avarice tainted every mind; and
<i>Pope</i>, being seized with the universal passion, ventured
some of his money. The stock rose in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
price; and he for a while thought himself <i>The Lord
of Thousands</i>. But this dream of happiness did not
last long: and he seems to have waked soon enough
to get clear with the loss only of what he once
thought himself to have won, and perhaps not
wholly that.'"</p>

<p>It appears from <i>Pope's</i> correspondence with <i>Atterbury</i>,
that the stock he had was at one time valued at
between twenty and thirty thousand pounds; and that
he was one of the lucky few who had "the good
fortune to remain with half of what they imagined
they had."&mdash;"Had you got all you have lost beyond
what you ventured," said the good Bishop
in reply, "consider that your superfluous gains
would have sprung from the ruin of several families
that now want necessaries."<a name="FNanchor_1_161" id="FNanchor_1_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_161" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>2. The <i>Fair</i><a name="FNanchor_1_162" id="FNanchor_1_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_162" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> [at <i>Southwark</i>]. <i>Invented, painted,
and engraved by W. Hogarth.</i>. The show-cloth, representing
the Stage Mutiny, is taken from a large etching
by <i>John Laguerre</i> (son of <i>Louis Laguerre</i>, the
historical painter), who sung at <i>Lincoln's-Inn Fields</i>
and <i>Covent-Garden</i> Theatres, painted some of their
scenes, and died in 1748. <i>The Stage-Mutineers</i>, or <i>A
Playhouse to be let</i>, a tragi-comi farcical-ballad-opera,
which was published in 1733, will throw some
light on the figures here represented by <i>Hogarth</i>. See
also the <i>Supplement</i> to <i>Dodsley's</i> Preface to his Collection
of Old Plays, and the "Biographia Dramatica,
1782."</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, in our artist's copy of this
etching, he has added a paint-pot and brushes at
the feet of the athletic figure <i>with a cudgel in his
hand</i>, who appears on the side of <i>Highmore</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_163" id="FNanchor_2_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_163" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
these circumstances it is evident that <i>John Ellis</i> the
painter (a pupil of Sir <i>James Thornhill</i>, a great frequenter
of <i>Broughton's</i> gymnasium, the stages of
other prize-fighters, &amp;c.) was the person designed.
<i>Ellis</i> was deputy-manager for Mrs. <i>Wilks</i>, and <i>took up
the cudgels</i> also for the new patentee. Mr. <i>Walpole</i>
observes that <i>Rysbrack</i>, when he produced that
"exquisite summary of his skill, knowledge, and
judgment," the <i>Hercules</i> now in Mr. <i>Hoare's</i> Temple
at <i>Stourhead</i>, modelled the legs of the God from
those of <i>Ellis</i>. This statue was compiled from the
various limbs and parts of seven or eight of the
strongest and best-made men in <i>London</i>, chiefly the
bruisers, &amp;c. of the then famous amphitheatre in
<i>Tottenham Court road</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Banks's</i> Works, vol. I. p. 97. is a Poetical
Epistle on this print, which alludes to the disputes
between the managers of <i>Drury-Lane</i>, and such of
the actors as were spirited up to rebellion by <i>Theophilus
Cibber</i>, and seceded to <i>The Haymarket</i> in 1733.
<i>Cibber</i> is represented under the character of <i>Pistol</i>;<a name="FNanchor_3_164" id="FNanchor_3_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_164" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
<i>Harper</i> under that of <i>Falstaff</i>. The figure in the
corner was designed for <i>Colley Cibber</i> the Laureat,
who had just sold his share in the play-house to Mr.
<i>Highmore</i>, who is represented holding a scroll, on
which is written "it cost £.6000." A monkey is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
exhibited sitting astride the iron that supports the
sign of <i>The Rose</i>, a well-known tavern. A label
issuing from his mouth contains the words: "<i>I am
a gentleman.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_4_165" id="FNanchor_4_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_165" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> <i>The Siege of Troy</i>, upon another
show-cloth, was a celebrated droll, composed by
<i>Elkanah Settle</i>, and printed in 1707; it was a great
favourite at fairs. A booth was built in <i>Smithfield</i>
this year for the use of <i>T. Cibber, Griffin, Bullock,</i> and
<i>H. Hallam</i>; at which the Tragedy of <i>Tamerlane</i>, with
<i>The Fall of Bajazet</i>, intermixed with the Comedy of
<i>The Miser</i>, was actually represented. The figure
vaulting on the rope was designed for Signor <i>Violante</i>,
who signalized himself in the reign of <i>Geo.</i> I.;
and the tall man exhibited on a show-cloth, was
<i>Maximilian</i>, a giant from <i>Upper Saxony</i>. The man
flying from the steeple was one <i>Cadman</i>, who, within
the recollection of some persons now living, descended
in the manner here described from the steeple of
<i>St. Martin's</i> into <i>The Mews</i>. He broke his neck soon
after, in an experiment of the like kind, at <i>Shrewsbury</i>,
and lies buried there in the churchyard of <i>St. Mary
Friars</i>, with the following inscription on a little tablet
inserted in the church-wall just over his grave.<a name="FNanchor_5_166" id="FNanchor_5_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_166" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
The lines are contemptible, but yet serve to particularize
the accident that occasioned his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
Let this small monument record the name<br />
Of <i>Cadman</i>, and to future times proclaim<br />
How, by an attempt to fly from this high spire<br />
Across the <i>Sabrine</i> stream, he did acquire<br />
His fatal end. 'Twas not for want of skill,<br />
Or courage, to perform the task, he fell:<br />
No, no,&mdash;a faulty cord, being drawn too tight,<br />
Hurry'd his soul on high to take her flight,<br />
Which bid the body here beneath, good night.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>A prelate being asked permission for a line to be
fixed to the steeple of a cathedral church, for this
daring adventurer, replied, the man might fix <i>to</i> the
church whenever he pleased, but he should never
give his consent to any one's flying <i>from</i> it. It seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
that some exhibitor of the same kind met with
a similar inhibition here in <i>London</i>. I learn from
<i>Mist's</i> Journal for <i>July</i> 8, 1727, that a sixpenny
pamphlet, intituled, "The Devil to pay at <i>St.
James's</i>, &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_6_167" id="FNanchor_6_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_167" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was published on this occasion,
Again, in <i>The Weekly Miscellany</i> for <i>April</i> 17, 1736.
"<i>Thomas Kidman</i>, the famous Flyer, who has flown
from several of the highest precipices in <i>England</i>,
and was the person that flew off <i>Bromham</i> steeple
in <i>Wiltshire</i> when it fell down, flew, on <i>Monday</i>
last, from the highest of the rocks near <i>The Hot-well</i>
at <i>Bristol</i>, with fire-works and pistols; after
which he went up the rope, and performed several
surprising dexterities on it, in sight of thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
spectators, both from <i>Somersetshire</i> and <i>Gloucestershire</i>."
In this print also is a portrait which has been
taken for that of Dr. <i>Rock</i>, but was more probably
meant for another Quack, who used to draw a crowd
round him by seeming to eat fire, which, having his
checks puffed up with tow, he blew out of his
mouth.<a name="FNanchor_7_168" id="FNanchor_7_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_168" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Some other particulars are explained in

gaming-house, and the patent of <i>Drury-Lane</i> theatre, completely
exhausted his finances. Having proved himself an unsuccessful
actor as well as manager, in 1743 he published
<i>Dettingen</i>, a poem which would have disgraced a Bell-man.
In 1744 he appeared again in the character of <i>Lothario</i>, for
the benefit of Mrs. <i>Horten</i>. From this period his history is
unknown. If <i>Hogarth's</i> representation of him, in the print entitled
<i>The Discovery</i>, was a just one, he had no external requisites
for the stage.</p></div>

King's Arms</i> in <i>Fleet street</i>, 1740, entitled "An Apology for the
life of Mr. <i>T&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;</i>, comedian; being a proper sequel
to the apology for the life of Mr. <i>Colley Cibber</i>, comedian;
with a historical view of the stage to the present year; supposed
to be written by himself in the stile and manner of
the Poet Laureat," but in reality the work of <i>Harry Fielding</i>;
the following passages, illustrative of our subject, occur.
"In that year when the stage fell into great commotions,
and the <i>Drury Lane</i> company, asserting the glorious cause of
liberty and property, made a stand against the oppressions
in the patentees&mdash;in that memorable year when the Theatric
Dominions fell in labour of a revolution under the conduct
of <i>myself</i>, that revolt gave occasion to several pieces of
wit and satirical flirts at the conductor of the enterprize. I
was attacked, as my father had been before me, in the
public papers and journals; and the burlesque character of
<i>Pistol</i> was attributed to me as a real one. Out came a
<i>Print</i> of <i>Jack Laguerre's</i>, representing, in most vile designing,
this expedition of ours, under the name of <i>The Stage
Mutiny</i>, in which, gentle reader, <i>your humble servant</i>, in the
<i>Pistol</i> character, was the principal figure. This I laughed
at, knowing it only a proper embellishment for one of
those necessary structures to which persons out of necessity
repair." p. 16, &amp;c.&mdash;Again, p. 88.&mdash;"At the Fair of <i>Bartholomew</i>,
we gained some recruits; but, besides those advantages
over the enemy, I myself went there in person,
and publickly <i>exposed</i> myself. This was done to fling defiance
in the Patentee's teeth; for, on the booth where I
exhibited, I hung out <i>The Stage Mutiny</i>, with <i>Pistol</i> at the
head of his troop, our standard bearing this motto,&mdash;<i>We
eat.</i>"&mdash;Whether this account which <i>Cibber</i> is made to give
of his own conduct is entirely jocular, or contains a mixture
of truth in it, cannot now be ascertained. <i>Hogarth</i>
might have transplanted a circumstance from <i>Bartholomew</i> to
<i>Southwark</i> Fair; or <i>Fielding</i>, by design, may have misrepresented
the matter, alluding at the same time to <i>Hogarth's</i>

<blockquote><p>
<i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Magnis tamen excidit ausis.</i><br />
Fond <i>Icarus</i> of old, with rash essay,<br />
In air attempted a forbidden way;<br />
Too thin the medium for so cumb'rous freight,<br />
Too weak the plumage to support the weight.<br />
Yet less he dar'd who soar'd on waxen wing,<br />
Than he who mounts to æther on a string.<br />
Just as <i>Arachne</i>, when the buzzing prey<br />
Entangled flutter, and would wing away,<br />
From watchful ambuscade insidious springs,<br />
And to a slender twine, ascending, clings.<br />
So on his rope, th' advent'rer climbs on high,<br />
Bounds o'er cathedral heights, and seeks the sky;<br />
Fix but his cable, and he'll tell you soon,<br />
What sort of natives cultivate the moon.<br />
An army of such wights to cross the main,<br />
Sooner than <i>Haddock's</i> fleet, shou'd humble <i>Spain</i>.<br />
As warring cranes on pigmies thund'ring fall,<br />
And, without scaling ladders, mount the wall,<br />
The proudest spire in <i>Salop's</i> lofty town<br />
Safely he gains, and glides as safely down;<br />
Then soars again aloft, and downward springs,<br />
Swift as an eagle, without aid of wings;<br />
Shews anticks, hangs suspended by his toe;<br />
Undazzled, views th' inverted chasm below.<br />
Invites with beat of drum brave voluntiers,<br />
Defies <i>Jack Spaniard</i>, nor invasion fears,<br />
Land when they will, they ne'er cou'd hurt <i>his ears</i>.<br />
Methink I see as yet his flowing hair<br />
And body, darting like a falling star:<br />
Swifter than what "with fins or feathers fly<br />
Thro' the ærial or the wat'ry sky."<br />
Once more he dares to brave the pathless way,<br />
Fate now pursuing, like a bird of prey;<br />
And, comet-like, he makes his latest tour,<br />
In air excentric (oh! ill-omen'd hour!)<br />
Bar'd in his shirt to please the gazing crowd,<br />
He little dreamt, poor soul! of winding shroud!<br />
Nothing could aught avail but limbs of brass,<br />
When ground was iron, and the <i>Severn</i> glass.<br />
As quick as lightning down his line he skims,<br />
Secure in equal poize of agile limbs.<br />
But see the trusted cordage faithless prove!<br />
Headlong he falls, and leaves his soul above:<br />
The gazing town was shock'd at the rebound<br />
Of shatter'd bones, that rattled on the ground;<br />
The broken cord rolls on in various turns,<br />
Smokes in the whirl, and as it runs it burns.<br />
So when the wriggling snake is snatch'd on high<br />
In eagle's claws, and hisses in the sky,<br />
Around the foe his twirling tail he flings,<br />
And twists her legs, and writhes about her wings.<br />
<i>Cadman</i> laid low, ye rash, behold and fear,<br />
Man is a reptile, and the ground his sphere.<br />
Unhappy man! thy end lamented be;<br />
Nought but thy own ill fate so swift as thee,<br />
Were metamorphoses permitted now,<br />
And tuneful <i>Ovid</i> liv'd to tell us how;<br />
His apter Muse shou'd turn thee to a daw,<br />
Nigh to the fatal steeple still to kaw;<br />
Perch on the cock, and nestle on the ball,<br />
In ropes no more confide, and never fall. <i>J. A.</i><br />

In this pamphlet our artist is incidentally mentioned, but
in such a manner as shews that he had attained some celebrity
so early as 1727. Speaking of some <i>Lilliputian</i> swine, supposed
to be in the possession of Dean <i>Swift</i>, Dr. <i>Arbuthnot</i> adds,
"But <i>Hogarth</i> the Engraver is making a print after them,
which will give a juster idea of them than I can."</p></div>

<p>1.<a name="FNanchor_1_170" id="FNanchor_1_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_170" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Harlot's Progress,<a name="FNanchor_2_171" id="FNanchor_2_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_171" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in six plates. In the
first is a portrait of Colonel <i>Chartres</i>. "Cette figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
de viellard (says <i>Rouquet</i>) est d'aprés nature; c'est
le portrait d'un officier très riche, fameux dans ce
tems-là pour de pareilles expéditions, grand séducteur
de campagnardes, et qui avoit toujours à
ses gages des femmes de la profession de celle
qui cajole ici la nouvelle débarquée." Behind him
is <i>John Gourlay</i> a Pimp, whom he always kept about
his person. The next figure that attracts our notice,
is that of Mother <i>Needham</i>. To prove this woman
was sufficiently notorious to have deserved the satire
of <i>Hogarth</i>, the following paragraphs in <i>The Grub-street
Journal</i> are sufficient.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 25, 1731. "The noted Mother <i>Needham</i>
was yesterday committed to <i>The Gatehouse</i> by
Justice <i>Railton</i>."</p>

<p>Ibid. "Yesterday, at the quarter-sessions for the
city and liberties of <i>Westminster</i>, the infamous Mother
<i>Needham</i>, who has been reported to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
dead for some time, to screen her from several
prosecutions, was brought from <i>The Gatehouse</i>, and
pleaded not guilty to an indictment found against
her for keeping a lewd and disorderly house; but,
for want of sureties, was remanded back to
prison."</p>

<p>Ibid. <i>April</i> 29, 1731. "Oh <i>Saturday</i> ended the
quarter-sessions for <i>Westminster</i>, &amp;c. The noted
Mother <i>Needham</i>, convicted for keeping a disorderly
house in <i>Park Place, St. James's,</i> was fined
One Shilling, to stand twice in the pillory, and find
sureties for her good behaviour for three years."</p>

<p>Ibid. <i>May</i> 6, 1731. "Yesterday the noted Mother
<i>Needham</i> stood in the pillory in <i>Park Place</i>,
near <i>St. James's-street</i>, and was roughly handled
by the populace. She was so very ill that she lay
along, notwithstanding which she was so severely
&amp;c. that it is thought she will die in a day or
two."&mdash;Another account says&mdash;"she lay along on
her face in the pillory, and so evaded the law
which requires that her face should be exposed."&mdash;"Yesterday
morning died Mother <i>Needham</i>. She
declared in her last words,<a name="FNanchor_3_172" id="FNanchor_3_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_172" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that what most affected
her was the terror of standing in the pillory to-morrow
in <i>New Palace-yard</i>, having been so ungratefully
used by the populace on <i>Wednesday</i>."</p>

<p>The memory of this woman is thus perpetuated
in <i>The Dunciad</i>, I. 323.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
"To <i>Needham's</i> quick the voice triumphal rode,<br />
But pious <i>Needham</i> dropt the name of God."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The note on this passage says, she was "a matron
of great fame, and very religious in her way;
whose constant prayer it was, that she might 'get
enough by her profession to leave it off in time,
and make her peace with God.'<a name="FNanchor_4_173" id="FNanchor_4_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_173" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But her fate was
not so happy; for being convicted, and set in the
pillory, she was (to the lasting shame of all her
great Friends and Votaries) so ill used by the populace,
that it put an end to her days."</p>

<p><i>Rouquet</i> has a whimsical remark relative to the
clergyman just arrived in <i>London</i>. "Cet ecclesiastique
monté sur un cheval blanc, <i>comme ils affectent ici
de l'être</i>."&mdash;The variations in this plate are; shade
thrown by one house upon another; <i>London</i> added on
the letter the parson is reading; change in one corner
of the fore-ground; the face of the Bawd much
altered for the worse, and her foot introduced.</p>

<p>Plate II. <i>Quin</i> compared <i>Garrick</i> in <i>Othello</i> to the
black boy with the tea-kettle,<a name="FNanchor_5_174" id="FNanchor_5_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_174" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a circumstance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
by no means encouraged our <i>Roscius</i> to continue acting
the part. Indeed, when his face was obscured,
his chief power of expression was lost; and then, and
not till then, was he reduced to a level with several
other performers. In a copy of this set of plates,
one of the two small portraits hanging up in the
<i>Jew's</i> bedchamber, is superscribed, <i>Clarke</i>; but
without authority from <i>Hogarth. Woolston</i> would
likewise have been out of his place, as he had written
against the <i>Jewish</i> tenets. Of this circumstance, <i>Hogarth</i>
was probably told by some friend, and therefore
effaced a name he had once ignorantly inserted.</p>

<p>In Plate III.<a name="FNanchor_6_175" id="FNanchor_6_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_175" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> (as already observed) is the portrait
of Sir <i>John Gonson</i>. That Sir <i>John Gonson</i> was the
person intended in this print, is evident from a circumstance
in the next, where, on a door in <i>Bridewell</i>,
a figure hanging is drawn in chalk, with an
inscription over it, "Sir <i>J. G.</i>" as well as from the
following explanation by <i>Rouquet</i>: "La figure, qui
paroit entrer sans bruit avec une partie de guet,
est un commissaire qui se distinguoit extrêmement
par son zèle pour la persecution des filles de joye."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Respecting another circumstance, however, in the
third plate, <i>Rouquet</i> appears to have met with some
particular information that has escaped me. "L'auteur
a saisi l'occasion d'un morceau de beurre qui
fait partie du déjeuné, pour l'enveloper plaisamment
dans le titre de la lettre pastorale qu'un grand
prelat<a name="FNanchor_7_176" id="FNanchor_7_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_176" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> addressa dans ce tems-là à son diocese, &amp;
dont plusieurs exemplaires eurent le malheur d'être
renvoyés à l'epicier."&mdash;The sleeve of the maid-servant's
gown in this plate is enlarged, and the neck
of a bottle on the table is lengthened.</p>

<p>For variations in Plate IV. see the roof of the
room. Shadow on the principal woman's petticoat,
and from the hoop-petticoat hanging up in the back
ground. The dog made darker. The woman next
the overseer has a high cap, which in the modern
impressions is lowered.</p>

<p>In Plate V. Roof of the room. Back of the chair.
Table. Dr. <i>Misaubin's</i> waistcoat. Name of Dr.
<i>Rock</i> on the paper lying on the close-stool. Dish
at the fire.</p>

<p>In a despicable poem published in 1732, under
the fictitious name of <i>Joseph Gay</i>, and intituled "<i>The
Harlot's Progress</i>, which is a key to the six prints
lately published by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>," the two quacks
in attendance on the dying woman are called <i>Tan&mdash;r</i>
and <i>G&mdash;m</i>. It is evident from several circumstances,
that this Mr. <i>J. Gay</i> became acquainted with our
author's work through the medium of a copy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>In Plate VI. the woman seated next the clergyman
was designed for <i>Elizabeth Adams</i>, who, at the
age of 30, was afterwards executed for a robbery,
<i>September</i> 10, 1737. The common print of her will
justify this assertion.</p>

<p>If we may trust the wretched metrical performance
just quoted, the Bawd in this sixth plate was designed
for Mother <i>Bentley</i>.</p>

<p>The portrait hanging up in the <i>Jew's</i> apartment
was originally subscribed "Mr. <i>Woolston</i>." There
was a scriptural motto to one of the other pictures;
and on the cieling of the room in which the girl is
dying, a certain obscene word was more visible than
it is at present. The former inscription on the paper
now inscribed Dr. <i>Rock</i>, was also a gross one. I should
in justice add, that before these plates were delivered
to the subscribers, the offensive particulars here mentioned
were omitted.</p>

<p>The following paragraph in <i>The Grub-street Journal</i>
for <i>September</i> 24, 1730, will sufficiently justify the
splendid appearance the Harlot makes in <i>Bridewell</i>.
See Plate IV. Such well-dressed females are rarely
met with in our present houses of correction.</p>

<p>"One <i>Mary Muffet</i>, a woman of great note in
the hundreds of <i>Drury</i>, who, about a fortnight
ago, was committed to hard labour in <i>Tothill-fields
Bridewell</i>, by nine justices, brought his Majesty's
writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, and was carried before the
right honourable the lord chief justice <i>Raymond</i>,
expecting to have been either bailed or discharged;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
but her commitment appearing to be legal, his
lordship thought fit to remand her back again to
her former place of confinement, where <i>she is now
beating hemp in a gown very richly laced with silver</i>."</p>

<p><i>Rouquet</i> concludes his illustration of the fifth plate
by observing, that the story might have been concluded
here. "L'auteur semble avoir rempli son
dessein. Il a suivi son heroine jusques au dernier
soupir. Il l'a conduite de l'infamie à la pauvreté,
par les voies séduisantes du libertinage. Son intention
de tâcher de retenir, ou de corriger celles
qui leur foiblesse, ou leur ignorance exposent tous
les jours à de semblables infortunes, est suffisament
executée; on peut donc dire que la tragedie finit
à cette planche, et que la suivante est comme le
petite piece. C'est une farce done la defunte est
plustôt l'occasion que le sujet."&mdash;Such is the criticism
of <i>Rouquet</i>; but I cannot absolutely concur
in the justness of it. <i>Hogarth</i> found an opportunity
to convey admonition, and enforce his moral, even
in this last plate. It is true that the exploits of our
heroine are concluded, and that she is no longer an
agent in her own story. Yet as a wish prevails, even
among those who are most humbled by their own
indiscretions, that some respect should be paid to
their remains, that they should be conducted by decent
friends to the grave, and interred by a priest
who feels for the dead that hope expressed in our
Liturgy, let us ask whether the memory of our Harlot
meets with any such marks of social attention, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
pious benevolence. Are not the preparations for her
funeral licentious, like the course of her life, as if
the contagion of her example had reached all the
company in the room? Her sisters in iniquity alone
surround her coffin. One of them is engaged in the
double trade of seduction and thievery. A second
is admiring herself in a mirror. A third gazes with
unconcern on the corpse. If any of the number appear
mournful, they express at best but a maudlin
sorrow, having glasses of strong liquor in their hands.
The very minister, forgetful of his office and character,
is shamefully employed; nor does a single
circumstance occur, throughout the whole scene, that
a reflecting female would not wish should be alienated
from her own interment.&mdash;Such is the plate which
our illustrator, with too much levity, has styled a
farce appended to a tragic representation.</p>

<p>He might, however, have exercised his critical
abilities with more success on <i>Hogarth's</i> neglect of
propriety, though it affords him occasion to display
his wit. At the burial of a wanton, who expired
in a garret, no escutcheons were ever hung up, or
rings given away; and I much question if any bawd
ever chose to avow that character before a clergyman,
or any infant was ever habited as chief mourner
to attend a parent to the grave.&mdash;I may add, that
when these pictures were painted (a time, if news-papers
are to be credited, when, having no established
police, every act of violence and licentiousness was
practised with impunity in our streets, and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of pleasure were brutally persecuted in every quarter
of the town), a funeral attended by such a sisterhood
would scarcely have been permitted to reach the place
of interment. Much however must be forgiven to
the morality of <i>Hogarth's</i> design, and the powers
with which it is executed. It may also, on the present
occasion, be observed, that in no other scene,
out of the many he has painted, has he so widely deviated
from <i>vraisemblance</i>.</p>

<p>The following verses, however wretched, being
explanatory of the set of plates already spoken of,
are here re-printed. They made their appearance
under the earliest and best of the pirated copies published
by <i>Bowles. Hogarth</i>, finding that such a metrical
description had its effect, resolved that his
next series of prints should receive the same advantage
from an abler hand.</p>

<p>Over the figure of the <i>Parson</i> is the letter A,
which conducts to the following explanation underneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>

from the justice due to his <i>villainies</i>, and daily
repeats them."</p>

<p>All but the first impressions of this set of plates
are marked thus †. None were originally printed
off except for the 1200 subscribers. Immediately
after they were served, the plates were retouched,
and some of the variations introduced.</p>

whence proceeds so many different designs or draughts on

a new story; but still fewer have invented both the story

was performed in character, was written by Mr.
<i>Huggins</i>, as has been already observed in p. <a href="#Page_187_3">187</a>; and
the line taken from it,</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The world shall bow to the <i>Assyrian</i> throne,"<br />

inv. pinx. &amp; sculp. Hogarth</i> soon discovered that this
engraving was too faintly executed; and therefore,
after taking off a few impressions in red as well as
black, he retouched and strengthened the plate.
Under this print are the following verses:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Think not to find one meant resemblance here,<br />
We lash the Vices, but the Persons spare.<br />

<p>Most of the figures, however, are supposed to be
real portraits. The Divine and the Lawyer,<a name="FNanchor_1_178" id="FNanchor_1_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_178" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in
particular, are well known to be so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>A pamphlet was published about the same time,
under the same title as this plate. In <i>Banks's</i> Poems,
vol. I. p. 87. the print is copied as a head-piece to
an Epistle to Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, on this performance. In
a note, it is said to have appeared after <i>The Harlot's
Progress</i>; and that in the original, and all the larger
copies, on the papers that hang out of the politician's
pocket at the end of the table, was written <i>The
Craftsman</i>, and <i>The London Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Of this print a good, but contracted copy, was
published (perhaps with <i>Hogarth's</i> permission), and
the following copy of verses engraved under it.</p>

<p><i>March</i> 22, 1742, was acted at <i>Covent-Garden</i>, a
new scene, called <i>A Modern Midnight Conversation</i>,
taken from <i>Hogarth's</i> celebrated print; in which was
introduced, <i>Hippisley's Drunken Man</i>, with a comic
tale of what really passed between himself and his
old aunt, at her house on <i>Mendip-Hills</i>, in <i>Somersetshire</i>.
For Mr. <i>Hippisley's</i> benefit.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_178" id="Footnote_1_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_178"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> These, in my first edition, I had ventured, on popular
report, to say were parson <i>Ford</i>, and the first Lord <i>Northington</i>,
when young. But I am now enabled to identify their persons,
on the authority of Sir <i>John Hawkins</i>: "When the Midnight
Modern Conversation came out, the general opinion was,
that the Divine was the portrait of Orator <i>Henley</i>; and the
Lawyer of <i>Kettleby</i>, a vociferous bar orator, remarkable,
though an utter barrister, for wearing a full-bottom'd wig,
which he is here drawn with, as also for a horrible squint."
</p>
<p>
In that once popular satire, <i>The Causidicade</i>, are the following
lines on this lawyer:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Up <i>Kettleby</i> starts with a <i>horrible stare!</i><br />
'Behold, my good Lord, your old friend at the bar,<br />
Or rather old foe, for foes we have been,<br />
As treason fell out, and poor traitors fell in.<br />
Strong opposites e'er, and not once of a side,<br />
Attornies will always great counsel divide.<br />
You <i>for</i> persecutions, I always <i>against</i>,<br />
How oft with a joke 'gainst your law have I fenc'd?<br />
How oft in your pleadings I've pick'd out a hole,<br />
Thro' which from your pounces my culprit I've stole;<br />
I've puzzled against you now eight years or nine,<br />
You, my Lord, for your King, I a &mdash;&mdash;l for mine.<br />
But what is all this? Now your Lordship will say,<br />
To get at the office this is not the way.<br />
I own it is not, so I make no request<br />
For myself, still firm to my party and test:<br />
But if 'tis your pleasure to give it my son,<br />
He shall take off his coif t'accept of the boon;<br />
That coif I, refusing, transferr'd upon him,<br />
For who'd be a serjeant where <i>P&mdash;&mdash;r</i> was Prime?<br />
That my son is a lawyer no one can gainsay,<br />
As witness his getting off <i>W&mdash;&mdash;te</i> t'other day.'<br />
Quo' my Lord, 'My friend <i>Abel</i>, I needs must allow<br />
You have puzzled me oft, as indeed you do now;<br />
Nay, have puzzled yourself, the court and the law,<br />
And chuckled most wittily over a flaw;<br />
For your nostrums, enigmas, conundrums, and puns,<br />
Are above comprehension, save that of your son's.<br />
To fling off the coif! Oh fye, my friend <i>Abel</i>,<br />
'Twould be acting the part of the Cock in the Fable!<br />
'Tis a badge of distinction! and some people buy it;<br />
Can you doubt on't, when <i>Skinner</i> and <i>Hayward</i> enjoy it?<br />
Tho' I own you have spoil'd (but I will not enlarge on't)<br />
A good Chancery draftsman to make a bad Serjeant.'"<br />

<h4>1735.</h4>


<p><a id="Page_207_1"></a>1. <a id="The_Rakes_Progress_in_eight_plates"></a>The Rake's Progress, in eight plates.</p>

<p>Extract from the <i>London Daily Post, May</i> 14, 1735:</p>

<p>"The nine prints from the paintings of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>,
one representing a Fair, and the others a
Rake's Progress, are now printing off, and will be
ready to be delivered on the 25th of <i>June</i> next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Subscriptions will be taken at Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i>, the
<i>Golden-Head</i>, in <i>Leicester-fields</i>, till the 23d of <i>June</i>,
and no longer, at half a guinea to be paid on subscribing,
and half a guinea more on delivery of
the prints at the price above-mentioned, after
which the price will be two guineas.</p>

<p>"N. B. Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> was, and is, obliged to defer
the publication and delivery of the abovesaid prints
till the 25th of <i>June</i> next, in order to secure his
property, pursuant to an act lately passed both
houses of parliament, now waiting for the royal
assent, to secure all new invented prints that shall
be published after the 24th of <i>June</i> next, from
being copied without consent of the proprietor,
and thereby preventing a scandalous and unjust
custom (hitherto practised with impunity) of making
and vending base copies of original prints, to
the manifest injury of the author, and the great
discouragement of the arts of painting and engraving."</p>

<p>In <i>The Craftsman</i>, soon afterwards, appeared the
following advertisement:</p>

<p>"Pursuant to an agreement with the subscribers
to the Rake's Progress, not to sell them for less
than two guineas each set after publication thereof,
the said original prints are to be had at Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i>,
the <i>Golden-Head</i>, in <i>Leicester-fields</i>; and at
<i>Tho. Bakewell's</i>, print-seller, next <i>Johnson's Court</i>,
in <i>Fleet-street</i>, where all other print-sellers may be
supplied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"In four days will be published, copies from the
said prints, with the consent of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, according
to the act of parliament, which will be
sold at 2 <i>s.</i> 6 <i>d.</i> each set, with the usual allowance
to all dealers in town and country; and, that the
the publick may not be imposed on, at the bottom of
each print will be inserted these words, <i>viz.</i> 'Published
with the consent of Mr. <i>William Hogarth</i>, by
<i>Tho. Bakewell</i>, according to act of parliament.'</p>

<p>"N. B. Any person that shall sell any other copies,
or imitations of the said prints, will incur
the penalties in the late act of parliament, and be
prosecuted for the same."</p>

<p>This series of plates, however, as Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes,
was pirated by <i>Boitard</i> on one very large sheet
of paper, containing the several scenes represented
by <i>Hogarth</i>. It came out a fortnight before the genuine
set, but was soon forgotten. The principal
variations in these prints are the following:</p>

<p>Plate I. The girl's face who holds the ring is
erased, and a worse is put in.<a name="FNanchor_1_179" id="FNanchor_1_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_179" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The mother's head,
&amp;c. is lessened. The shoe-sole, cut from the cover
of an ancient family Bible, together with a chest, is
added; the memorandum-book removed into another
place; the woollen-draper's shop bill,<a name="FNanchor_2_180" id="FNanchor_2_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_180" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> appended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to a roll of black cloth, omitted; the contents of the
closet thrown more into shade.</p>

<p>In Plate II. are portraits of <i>Figg</i>, the prize-fighter;<a name="FNanchor_3_181" id="FNanchor_3_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_181" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
<i>Bridgeman</i>, a noted gardener; and <i>Dubois</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
a master of defence, who was killed in a duel by
one of the same name, as the following paragraphs
in <i>The Grub-street Journal</i> for <i>May</i> 16, 1734, &amp;c. will
testify: "Yesterday (<i>May</i> 11) between two and three
in the afternoon, a duel was fought in <i>Mary-le-bone
Fields</i>, between Mr. <i>Dubois</i> a <i>Frenchman</i>, and Mr.
<i>Dubois</i> an <i>Irishman</i>, both fencing-masters, the former
of whom was run through the body, but
walked a considerable way from the place, and is
now under the hands of an able surgeon, who has
great hopes of his recovery."</p>

<p><i>May</i> 23, 1734, "Yesterday morning died Mr.
<i>Dubois</i>, of a wound he received in a duel."</p>

<p>The portrait of <i>Handel</i> has been supposed to be
represented in the plate before us; but "this," as
Sir <i>John Hawkins</i> observes to me, "is too much to say.
Mr. <i>Handel</i> had a higher sense of his own merit than
ever to put himself in such a situation; and, if so,
the painter would hardly have thought of doing it.
The musician must mean in general any composer
of operas." On the floor lies a picture representing
<i>Farinelli</i>, seated on a pedestal, with an altar before
him, on which are several flaming hearts, near
which stand a number of people with their arms extended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
offering him presents: at the foot of the altar
is one female kneeling, tendering her heart.
From her mouth a label issues, inscribed, "One
God, one <i>Farinelli</i>;" alluding to a lady of distinction,
who, being charmed with a particular passage
in one of his songs, uttered aloud from the
boxes that impious exclamation. On the figure of
the captain, <i>Rouquet</i> has the following remark: "Ce
caractere ne paroit plus <i>Italien</i> qu'<i>Anglois</i>." I am
not sufficiently versed in <i>Alsatian</i> annals to decide on
the question; but believe that the bully by profession
(not assassin, as <i>Rouquet</i> seems to interpret the
character) was to be found during the youth of our
artist. More have heard and been afraid of these
vulgar heroes, than ever met with them. This set
of prints was engraved by <i>Scotin</i> chiefly; but several
of the faces were touched upon by <i>Hogarth</i>. In
the second plate the countenance of the man with
the quarter-staves was wholly engraved by <i>Hogarth</i>.
In some early proofs of the print, there is not a single
feature on this man's face; there is no writing
either in the musician's book, or on the label; nor is
there the horse-race cup, the letter, or the poem
that lies at the end of the label, that being entirely
blank. I mention these circumstances to shew that
our artist would not entrust particular parts of his
work to any hand but his own; or perhaps he had
neither determined on the countenance or the inscription
he meant to introduce, till the plate was
far advanced. With unfinished proofs, on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
other account, this catalogue has nothing to do.
As the rudiments of plates, they may afford instruction
to young engravers; or add a fancied value to
the collections of connoisseurs.</p>

<p>In the third plate is <i>Leather-coat</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_182" id="FNanchor_4_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_182" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a noted porter
belonging to <i>The Rose</i> Tavern, with a large pewter
dish in his hand, which for many years served as a
sign to the shop of a pewterer on <i>Snow-Hill</i>. In this
utensil the posture-woman, who is undressing, used
to whirl herself round, and display other feats of
indecent activity: "II suffit" (I transcribe from
<i>Rouquet</i>, who is more circumstantial) "de vous
laisser à deviner la destination de la chandelle. Ce
grand plat va servir a cette femme comme à une
poularde. Il sera mis au milieu de la table; elle
s'y placera sur le dos; et l'ivresse et l'esprit de
débauche feront trouver plaisant un jeu, qui de
sang-froid ne le paroit guères." <i>Rouquet</i>, in his
description of an <i>English</i> tavern, such as that in
which our scene lies, mentions the following as extraordinary
conveniencies and articles of magnificence:
"Du linge toujours blanc<a name="FNanchor_5_183" id="FNanchor_5_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_183" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;de tables de bois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
qu'on appelle ici mahogani&mdash;grand feu et gratis."
Variations: <i>Pontac's</i> head is added in the room of a
mutilated <i>Cæsar</i>. Principal woman has a man's hat
on. Rake's head altered. Undrest woman's head
altered. Woman who spirts the wine, and she who
threatens her with a drawn knife, have lower caps, &amp;c.</p>

<p>So entirely do our manners differ from those of
fifty years ago, that I much question if at present, in
all the taverns of <i>London</i>, any thing resembling the
scene here exhibited by <i>Hogarth</i> could be found.
That we are less sensual than our predecessors, I do
not affirm; but may with truth observe, we are more
delicate in pursuit of our gratifications.&mdash;No young
man, of our hero's fortune and education, would now
think of entertaining half a score of prostitutes at a
tavern, after having routed a set of feeble wretches,
who are idly called our Guardians of the Night.</p>

<p>Plate IV. <i>Rakewell</i> is going to court on the first
of <i>March</i>, which was Queen <i>Caroline's</i> birth-day, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
well as the anniversary of <i>St. David</i>. In the early
impressions a shoe-black steals the Rake's cane. In
the modern ones, a large group of blackguards<a name="FNanchor_6_184" id="FNanchor_6_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_184" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> [the
chimney-sweeper peeping over the poll boy's cards,
and discovering that he has two honours, by holding
up two fingers, is among the luckiest of <i>Hogarth's</i>
traits] are introduced gambling on the pavement;
near them a stone inscribed <span class="smcap">Black's</span>, a contrast to
<i>White's</i> gaming-house, against which a flash of lightning
is pointed. The curtain in the window of the
sedan chair is thrown back. This plate is likewise
found in an intermediate state;<a name="FNanchor_7_185" id="FNanchor_7_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_185" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the sky being made
unnaturally obscure, with an attempt to introduce a
shower of rain, and lightning very aukwardly represented.
It is supposed to be a first proof after the
insertion of the group of black-guard gamesters;
the window of the chair being only marked for an
alteration that was afterwards made in it. <i>Hogarth</i>
appears to have so far spoiled the sky, that he was
obliged to obliterate it, and cause it to be engraved
over again by another hand.<a name="FNanchor_8_186" id="FNanchor_8_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_186" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Not foreseeing, however,
the immense demand for his prints, many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
them were so slightly executed, as very early to stand
in need of retouching. The seventh in particular
was so much more slightly executed than the rest,
that it sooner wanted renovation, and is therefore to
be found in three different states. The rest appear
only in two.</p>

<p>In Plate V. is his favourite dog <i>Trump</i>. In this,
also the head of the maid-servant is greatly altered,
and the leg and foot of the bridegroom omitted.</p>

<p>From the antiquated bride, and the young female
adjusting the folds of her gown, in this plate, is taken
a <i>French</i> print of a wrinkled harridan of fashion at
her toilet, attended by a blooming coëffeuse. It was
engraved by <i>L. Surugue</i> in 1745, from a picture in
crayons by <i>Coypel</i>, and is entitled, <i>La Folie pare la Decrepitude
des ajustemens de la Jeunesse</i>. From the <i>Frenchman</i>,
however, the <i>Devonshire-square</i> dowager of our
artist has received so high a polish, that she might
be mistaken for a queen mother of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Gilpin</i>, in his remarks on this plate, appears
not to have fully comprehended the extent of the
satire designed in it. Speaking of the church, he
observes, that "the wooden post, which seems to have
no use, divides the picture disagreeably." <i>Hogarth</i>,
however, meant to expose the insufficiency of such
ecclesiastical repairs as are confided to the superintendance
of parish-officers. We learn, from an inscription
on the front of a pew, that "This church
was beautified in the Year 1725. <i>Tho. Sice, Tho. Horn,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Churchwardens."<a name="FNanchor_9_187" id="FNanchor_9_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_187" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The print before us
came out in 1735 (i. e. only ten years afterwards),
and by that time the building might have been found
in the condition here exhibited, and have required a
prop to prevent part of its roof from falling in.&mdash;As
a proof that this edifice was really in a ruinous state,
it was pulled down and rebuilt in the year 1741.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago, <i>Marybone</i> church was considered
at such a distance from <i>London</i>, as to become the
usual resort of those who, like our hero, wished to
be privately married.</p>

<p>In Plate VI. the fire breaking out, alludes to the
same accident which happened at <i>White's, May</i> 3,
1733. I learn from a very indifferent poem descriptive
of this set of plates (the title is unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
wanting), that some of the characters in the scene
before us were real ones:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"But see the careful plain old man,<br />
<i>M&mdash;&mdash;</i><a name="FNanchor_10_188" id="FNanchor_10_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_188" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, well-known youth to trepan,<br />
To <i>C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;sh</i><a name="FNanchor_11_189" id="FNanchor_11_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_189" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> lend the dear bought pence,<br />
<i>C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;sh</i> quite void of common sense,<br />
Whose face, unto his soul a sign,<br />
Looks stupid, as does that within.<br />
A quarrel from behind ensues,<br />
The sure retreat of those that lose.<br />
An honest <i>'Squire</i> smells the cheat,<br />
And swears the villain shall be beat:<br />
But <i>G&mdash;&mdash;dd</i> wisely interferes,<br />
And dissipates the wretch's fears."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The original sketch in oil for this scene is at Mrs.
<i>Hogarth's</i> house in <i>Leicester-fields</i>. The principal
character was then sitting, and not, as he is at present,
thrown upon his knees in the act of execration.</p>

<p>The thought of the losing gamester pulling his hat
over his brows is adopted from a similar character
to be found among the figures of the principal personages
in the court of <i>Louis</i> XIV. folio. This work
has no engraver's name, but was probably executed
about the year 1700.</p>

<p>Plate VII. The celebrated <i>Beccaria</i>, in his "Essay
on Public Happiness," vol. II. p. 172, observes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
"I am sensible there are persons whom it will be
difficult for me to persuade: I mean those profound
contemplators, who, secluding themselves
from their fellow-creatures, are assiduously employed
in framing laws for them, and who frequently
neglect the care of their domestic and
private concerns, to prescribe to empires that form
of government, to which they imagine that they
ought to submit. The celebrated <i>Hogarth</i> hath
represented, in one of his moral engravings, a
young man who, after having squandered away his
fortune, is, by his creditors, lodged in a gaol.
There he sits, melancholy and disconcerted, near a
table, whilst a scroll lies under his feet, and bears
the following title: 'being a new scheme for
paying the debt of the nation. By <i>T. L.</i> now a
prisoner in <i>The Fleet</i>.'"</p>

<p>The Author of the poem already quoted, intimates
that the personage in the night-gown was meant for
some real character:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"His wig was full as old as he,<br />
In which one curl you could not see.<br />
His neckcloth loose, his beard full grown,<br />
An old torn night-gown not his own.<br />
<i>L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i>, great schemist, that can pay,<br />
The nation's debt an easy way."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In Plate VIII. (which appears in three different
states) is a half-penny reversed (struck in the year
1763) and fixed against the wall, intimating, that
<i>Britannia</i> herself was fit only for a mad-house. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
was a circumstance inserted by our artist (as he advertises)
about a year before his death. I may add,
that the man drawing lines against the wall just over
the half-penny, alludes to <i>Whiston's</i> proposed method
of discovering the Longitude by the firing of bombs,
as here represented. The idea of the two figures at
each corner of the print appears to have been taken
from <i>Cibber's</i> statues at <i>Bedlam</i>. The faces of the two
females are also changed. That of the woman with
a fan, is entirely altered; she has now a cap on, instead
of a hood, and is turned, as if speaking to the
other.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Gilpin's</i> opinion concerning this set of prints
is too valuable to be omitted, and is therefore transcribed
below.<a name="FNanchor_12_190" id="FNanchor_12_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_190" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The plates were thus admirably
illustrated by Dr. <i>John Hoadly</i>.</p>

<p>On this occasion also appeared an 8vo pamphlet,
intituled, "The Rake's Progress, or the Humours of
<i>Drury-Lane</i>, a poem in eight canto's, in <i>Hudibrastick</i>
verse, being the ramble of a modern <i>Oxonian</i>,
which is a compleat key to the eight prints
lately published by the celebrated Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>."
The second edition with additions, particularly an
"epistle to Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>" was "printed for <i>J. Chetwood</i>,
and sold at <i>Inigo Jones's-Head</i> against <i>Exeter
Change</i> in <i>The Strand</i>, 1735." This is a most
contemptible and indecent performance. Eight prints
are inserted in some copies of it; but they are only
the designs of <i>Hogarth</i> murdered, and perhaps were
not originally intended for the decoration of the work
already described.</p>

<p>The original paintings, both of the Rake's and
Harlot's Progress, were at <i>Fonthill</i>, in <i>Wiltshire</i>, the
seat of Mr. <i>Beckford</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_193" id="FNanchor_13_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_193" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> where the latter were destroyed
by a fire, in the year 1755; the former set
was happily preserved. Mr. <i>Barnes</i>, of <i>Rippon</i>, in
<i>Yorkshire</i>, has the Harlot's Progress in oil. It
must, however, be a copy. Mr. <i>Beckford</i> has also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
twenty-five heads from the Cartoons by <i>Hogarth</i>, for
which he paid twenty-five guineas.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that <i>Hogarth</i> once designed
to have introduced the ceremony of a <i>Marriage
Contract</i> into the Rake's Progress, instead of the
<i>Levee</i>. An unfinished painting of this scene is still
preserved. We have here the Rake's apartment as
now exhibited in Plate II. In the anti-room, among
other figures, we recognize that of the poet who at
present congratulates our hero on his accession to
wealth and pleasure. The bard is here waiting with
an epithalamium in his hand. The Rake has added
connoisseurship to the rest of his expensive follies.
One of his purchases is a canvas containing only the
representation of a human foot. [Perhaps this circumstance
might allude to the dissection of <i>Arlaud's
Leda</i>. See Mr. <i>Walpole's</i> Anecdotes, &amp;c. vol. IV.
p. 39.] A second is so obscure, that no objects in
it are discernible. [A performance of the same
description is introduced in our artist's <i>Piquet, or Virtue
in Danger</i>.] A third presents us with a <i>Madona</i>
looking down with fondness on the infant she holds
in her arms. [This seems intended as a contrast
to the grey headed bride who sits under it, and
is apparently past child-bearing.] The fourth is
emblematical, and displays perhaps too licentious a
satire on transubstantiation. The Blessed Virgin is
thrusting her Son down the hopper of a mill, in
which he is ground by priests till he issues out in the
shape of the consecrated <i>wafer</i>, supposed by Catholicks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to contain the <i>real presence</i>. At a table sits a
toothless decrepit father, guardian, or match-maker,
joining the hand of the rake with that of the antiquated
female, whose face is highly expressive of
eagerness, while that of her intended husband is directed
a contrary way, toward a groom who is bringing
in a piece of plate won at a horse-race.<a name="FNanchor_14_194" id="FNanchor_14_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_194" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> On the
floor in front lie a heap of mutilated busts, &amp;c.
which our spendthrift is supposed to have recently
purchased at an auction. The black boy, who is
afterwards met with in Plate IV. of Marriage Alamode,
was transplanted from this canvas. He is
here introduced supporting such a picture of <i>Ganymede</i>
as hangs against the wall of the lady's dressing-room
in the same plate of the same work.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_179" id="Footnote_1_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_179"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The face of this female has likewise been changed on
the last plate. In the intermediate ones it remains as originally
designed. To give the same character two different casts
of countenance, was surely an incongruity without excuse.</p></div>

by <i>Overton. Figg</i> died in the year 1734. As the taste of the
publick is much changed about the importance of the <i>noble</i>
Science of Defence, as it was called, and as probably it will
never again revive, it may afford some entertainment to my
readers, to see the terms in which this celebrated prize-fighter
is spoken of by a professor of the art. "<span class="smcap">Figg</span> was the <i>Atlas</i>
of the Sword; and may he remain the gladiating statue!
In him strength, resolution, and unparalleled judgement,
conspired to form a matchless master. There was a majesty
shone in his countenance, and blazed in all his actions,
beyond all I ever saw. His right leg bold and firm, and
his left, which could hardly ever be disturbed, gave him the
surprising advantage already proved, and struck his adversary
with despair and panic. He had that peculiar way of
stepping in I spoke of, in a parry; he knew his arm, and
its just time of moving; put a firm faith in that, and never
let his adversary escape his parry. He was just as much a
greater master than any other I ever saw, as he was a
greater judge of time and measure." <i>Captain John Godfrey's
Treatise upon the Useful Science of Defence</i>, 4to, 1747, p. 41.
"Mr. <i>Figg</i>," says <i>Chetwood</i>, History of the Stage, p. 60,
"informed me once, that he had not bought a shirt for more
than twenty years, but had sold some dozens. It was his
method, when he fought in his amphitheatre (his stage
bearing that superb title), to send round to a select number
of his scholars, to borrow a shirt for the ensuing combat,
and seldom failed of half a dozen of superfine Holland
from his prime pupils (most of the young nobility and
gentry made it a part of their education to march under his
warlike banner). This champion was generally conqueror,
though his shirt seldom failed of gaining a cut from his
enemy, and sometimes his flesh, though I think he never
received any dangerous wound. Most of his scholars were
at every battle, and were sure to exult at their great master's
victories, every person supposing he saw the wounds his shirt
received. Mr. <i>Figg</i> took his opportunity to inform his
lenders of linen of the chasms their shirts received, with a
promise to send them home. But, said the ingenious courageous
<i>Figg</i>, I seldom received any other answer than
D-mn you, keep it!" A Poem by Dr. <i>Byrom</i>, on a battle
between <i>Figg</i> and <i>Sutton</i>, another prize-fighter, is in the 6th

impression on the mind of M. <i>De Grosley</i>, who, in his
"Tour to <i>London</i>," observes, that "The plate, hearth-stones,
moveables, apartments, doors, stairs, the very street-doors,
their locks, and the large brass knockers, are every day
washed, scowered, or rubbed. Even in lodging-houses, the
middle of the stairs is often covered with carpeting, to prevent
them from being soiled. All the apartments in the
house have mats or carpets; and the use of them has been
adopted some years since by the <i>French</i>;" and that "The
towns and villages upon the road have excellent inns, but
somewhat dear; at these an <i>English</i> lord is as well served as
at his own house, and with a cleanliness much to be wished
for in most of the best houses of <i>France</i>. The innkeeper
makes his appearance only to do the honours of his table to
the greatest personages, who often invite him to dine with
them."</p></div>

in the same plate. When he had inserted the storm,
he began to consider the impropriety of turning the girl out
in the midst of it with her head uncovered; and therefore,
on a proof of this print, from which he designed to have
worked, he sketched her hat in with <i>Indian</i> ink.</p></div>

<i>Tho. Sice</i> and <i>Tho. Horn</i> are not fictitious names. Such people
were really churchwardens when the repairs in 1725 were
made. The following inscription on the pew, denoting a
vault beneath, is also genuine, and, as far as can be known at
present, was faithfully copied in regard to its obsolete spelling.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
THESE PEWES VNSCRVD AND TANE IN SVNDER<br />
IN STONE THERS GRAVEN WHAT IS VNDER<br />
TO WIT A VALT FOR BURIAL THERE IS<br />
WHICH EDWARD FORSET MADE FOR HIM AND HIS.<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Part of these words, in raised letters, at present form a pannel
in the wainscot at the end of the right-hand gallery, as the
church is entered from the street.&mdash;No heir of the <i>Forset</i> family
appearing, their vault has been claimed and used by his
Grace the Duke of <i>Portland</i>, as lord of the manor. The
mural monument of the <i>Taylors</i>, composed of lead gilt over,
is likewise preserved. It is seen, in <i>Hogarth's</i> print, just under
the window. The bishop of the diocese, when the new church
was built, gave orders that all the ancient tablets should be
placed, as nearly as possible, in their former situations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_190" id="Footnote_12_190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_190"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> "The first print of this capital work is an excellent representation
of a young heir, taking possession of a miser's
effects. The passion of avarice, which hoards every thing,
without distinction, what is and what is not valuable, is admirably
described.&mdash;The <i>composition</i>, though not excellent,
is not unpleasing. The principal group, consisting of the
young gentleman, the taylor, the appraiser, the papers,
and chest, is well shaped: but the eye is hurt by the disagreeable
regularity of three heads nearly in a line, and at
equal distances.&mdash;The <i>light</i> is not ill disposed. It falls on
the principal figures: but the effect might have been improved.
If the extreme parts of the mass (the white apron
on one side, and the memorandum-book on the other) had
been in shade, the <i>repose</i> had been less injured. The detached
parts of a group should rarely catch a strong body of
light.&mdash;We have no striking instances of <i>expression</i> in this
print. The principal figure is unmeaning. The only one,
which displays the true <i>vis comica</i> of <i>Hogarth</i>, is the appraiser
fingering the gold. You enter at once into his character.&mdash;The
young woman might have furnished the artist with
an opportunity of presenting a graceful figure; which would
have been more pleasing. The figure he <i>has</i> introduced, is
by no means an object of allurement.&mdash;The <i>perspective</i> is
accurate, but affected. So many windows, and open doors,
may shew the author's learning; but they break the back
ground, and injure the simplicity of it.
</p>
<p>
"The second print introduces our hero into all the dissipation
of modish life. We became first acquainted with
him, when a boy of eighteen. He is now of age; has
entirely thrown off the clownish school-boy; and assumes
the man of fashion. Instead of the country taylor, who
took measure of him for his father's mourning, he is now
attended by <i>French</i> barbers, <i>French</i> taylors, poets, milleners,
jockies, bullies, and the whole retinue of a fine gentleman.&mdash;The
<i>expression</i>, in this print, is wonderfully great. The
dauntless front of the bully; the keen eye, and elasticity of
the fencing-master; and the simpering importance of the
dancing-master, are admirably expressed. The last is perhaps
a little <i>outré</i>. The architect<a name="FNanchor_A_191" id="FNanchor_A_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_191" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> is a strong copy from nature.&mdash;The
<i>composition</i> seems to be entirely subservient to the
expression. It appears, as if <i>Hogarth</i> had sketched, in his
memorandum-book, all the characters which he has here
introduced; but was at a loss how to group them; and
chose rather to introduce them in detached figures, as he
had sketched them, than to lose any part of the expression
by combining them.&mdash;The <i>light</i> is ill distributed. It is
spread indiscriminately over the print; and destroys the
<i>whole</i>&mdash;We have no instance of <i>grace</i> in any of the figures.
The principal figure is very deficient. There is no contrast
in the limbs; which is always attended with a degree of
ungracefulness.&mdash;The <i>execution</i> is very good. It is elaborate,
and yet free.&mdash;The satire on operas, though it may be
well directed, is forced and unnatural.
</p>
<p>
"The third plate carries us still deeper into the history.
We meet our hero engaged in one of his evening amusements.
This print, on the whole, is no very extraordinary
effort of genius.&mdash;The <i>design</i> is good; and may be a very
exact description of the humours of a brothel.&mdash;The <i>composition</i>
too is not amiss. But we have few of those masterly
strokes which distinguish the works of <i>Hogarth</i>. The whole
is plain history. The lady setting the world on fire is the
best thought: and there is some humour in furnishing the
room with a set of <i>Cæsars</i>; and not placing them in order.&mdash;The
<i>light</i> is ill managed. By a few alterations, which are
obvious, particularly by throwing the lady dressing into
the shade, the disposition of it might have been tolerable.
But still we should have had an absurdity to answer, whence
comes it? Here is light in abundance; but no visible
source.&mdash;<i>Expression</i> we have a little through the whole
print. That of the principal figure is the best. The ladies
have all the air of their profession; but no variety of character.
<i>Hogarth's</i> women are, in general, very inferior to
his men. For which reason I prefer the <i>Rake's Progress</i> to
the <i>Harlot's</i>. The female face indeed has seldom strength
of feature enough to admit the strong markings of expression.
</p>
<p>
"Very disagreeable accidents often befall gentlemen of
pleasure. An event of this kind is recorded in the fourth
print; which is now before us. Our hero going, in full
dress, to pay his compliments at court on St. <i>David's</i> day,
was accosted in the rude manner which is here represented.&mdash;The
<i>composition</i> is good. The form of the group, made
up of the figures in action, the chair, and the lamp-lighter,
is pleasing. Only, here we have an opportunity of remarking,
that a group is disgusting when the extremities
of it are heavy. A group in some respect should resemble
a tree. The heavier part of the foliage (the <i>cup</i> as the
landscape painter calls it) is always near the middle; the
outside branches, which are relieved by the sky, are light
and airy. An inattention to this rule has given a heaviness
to the group before us. The two bailiffs, the woman, and
the chairman, are all huddled together in that part of the
group which should have been the lightest; while the middle
part, where the hand holds the door, wants strength
and consistence. It may be added too, that the four heads,
in the form of a diamond, make an unpleasing shape. All
regular figures should be studiously avoided.&mdash;The <i>light</i> had
been well distributed, if the bailiff holding the arrest, and
the chairman, had been a little lighter, and the woman
darker. The glare of the white apron is disagreeable.&mdash;We
have, in this print, some beautiful instances of <i>expression</i>.
The surprise and terror of the poor gentleman is apparent
in every limb, as far as is consistent with the fear of
discomposing his dress. The insolence of power in one of
the bailiffs, and the unfeeling heart, which can jest with
misery, in the other, are strongly marked. The self-importance
too of the honest <i>Cambrian</i> is not ill portrayed; who
is chiefly introduced to settle the chronology of the story.&mdash;In
point of <i>grace</i>, we have nothing striking. <i>Hogarth</i> might
have introduced a degree of it in the female figure: at least
he might have contrived to vary the heavy and unpleasing
form of her drapery.&mdash;The <i>perspective</i> is good, and makes
an agreeable shape.&mdash;I cannot leave this print without
remarking the <i>falling band-box</i>. Such representations of
quick motion are absurd; and every moment the absurdity
grows stronger. You cannot deceive the eye. The falling
body <i>must</i> appear <i>not</i> to fall. Objects of that kind are beyond
the power of representation.
</p>
<p>
"Difficulties crowd so fast upon our hero, that at the age
of twenty-five, which he seems to have attained in the fifth
plate, we find him driven to the necessity of marrying a
woman, whom he detests, for her fortune. The <i>composition</i>
here is very good; and yet we have a disagreeable regularity
in the climax of the three figures, the maid, the
bride, and the bride-groom.&mdash;The <i>light</i> is not ill distributed.
The principal figure too is <i>graceful</i>; and there is strong
<i>expression</i> in the seeming tranquillity of his features. He
hides his contempt of the object before him as well as he
can; and yet he cannot do it. She too has as much meaning
as can appear thro' the deformity of her features. The
clergyman's face we are all well acquainted with, and also his
wig; tho' we cannot pretend to say, where we have seen
either. The clerk too is an admirable fellow.&mdash;The <i>perspective</i>
is well understood; but the church is too small;<a name="FNanchor_B_192" id="FNanchor_B_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_192" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
and the wooden post, which seems to have no use, divides
the picture very disagreeably.&mdash;The creed lost, the commandments
broken, and the poor's-box obstructed by a
cobweb, are all excellent strokes of satirical humour.
</p>
<p>
"The fortune, which our adventurer has just received,
enables him to make one push more at the gaming-table.
He is exhibited, in the sixth print, venting curses on his
folly for having lost his last stake.&mdash;This is upon the whole,
perhaps, the best print of the set. The horrid scene it
describes was never more inimitably drawn. The <i>composition</i>
is artful, and natural. If the shape of the whole be
not quite pleasing, the figures are so well grouped, and
with so much ease and variety, that you cannot take
offence.&mdash;In point of light, it is more culpable. There is
not shade enough among the figures to balance the glare.
If the neck-cloth and weepers of the gentleman in mourning
had been removed, and his hands thrown into shade,
even that alone would have improved the effect.&mdash;The <i>expression</i>,
in almost every figure, is admirable; and the whole
is a strong representation of the human mind in a storm.
Three stages of that species of madness, which attends
gaming, are here described. On the first shock, all is inward
dismay. The ruined gamester is representing leaning
against a wall, with his arms across, lost in an agony of
horror. Perhaps never passion was described with so much
force. In a short time this horrible gloom bursts into a
storm of fury: he tears in pieces what comes next him;
and, kneeling down, invokes curses upon himself. He next
attacks others; every one in his turn whom he imagines
to have been instrumental in his ruin.&mdash;The eager joy of
the winning gamesters, the attention of the usurer, the
vehemence of the watchman, and the profound reverie of
the highwayman, are all admirably marked. There is
great coolness too expressed in the little we see of the fat
gentleman at the end of the table. The figure opposing
the mad-man is bad: it has a drunken appearance; and
drunkenness is not the vice of a gaming table.&mdash;The principal
figure is <i>ill-drawn</i>. The <i>perspective</i> is formal; and
the <i>execution</i> but indifferent: in heightening his expression,
<i>Hogarth</i> has lost his spirit.
</p>
<p>
"The seventh plate, which gives us the view of a jail, has
very little in it. Many of the circumstances, which may
well be supposed to increase the misery of a confined debtor,
are well contrived; but the fruitful genius of <i>Hogarth</i>, I
should think, might have treated the subject in a more copious
manner. The episode of the fainting woman might
have given way to many circumstances more proper to the
occasion. This is the same woman, whom the rake discards
in the first print; by whom he is rescued in the fourth;
who is present at his marriage; who follows him into jail;
and, lastly, to <i>Bedlam</i>. The thought is rather unnatural,
and the moral certainly culpable.&mdash;The <i>composition</i> is bad.
The group of the woman fainting is a round heavy mass:
and the other group is very ill-shaped. The <i>light</i> could not
be worse managed, and, as the groups are contrived, can
hardly be improved.&mdash;In the principal figure there is great
<i>expression</i>; and the fainting scene is well described. A
scheme to pay off the national debt, by a man who cannot
pay his own; and the attempt of a silly rake, to retrieve
his affairs by a work of genius; are admirable strokes of
humour.
</p>
<p>
"The eighth plate brings the fortune of our hero to a
conclusion. It is a very expressive representation of the
most horrid scene which human nature can exhibit.&mdash;The
<i>composition</i> is not bad. The group, in which the lunatic is
chained, is well managed; and if it had been carried a
little further towards the middle of the picture, and the
two women (who seem very oddly introduced) had been
removed, both the composition, and the distribution of
light, had been good.&mdash;The <i>drawing</i> of the principal figure
is a more accurate piece of anatomy than we commonly
find in the works of this master. The <i>expression</i> of the
figure is rather unmeaning; and very inferior to the strong
characters of all the other lunatics. The fertile genius of
the artist has introduced as many of the causes of madness,
as he could well have collected; but there is some tautology.
There are two religionists, and two astronomers.
Yet there is variety in each; and strong <i>expression</i> in all the
characters. The self-satisfaction, and conviction, of him
who has discovered the longitude; the mock majesty of the
monarch; the moody melancholy of the lover; and the
superstitious horror of the popish devotee; are all admirable.&mdash;The
<i>perspective</i> is simple and proper.
</p>
<p>
"I should add, that these remarks are made upon the first
edition of this work. When the plates were much worn,
they were altered in many parts. They have gained by the
alterations, in point of <i>design</i>; but have lost in point of
<i>expression</i>."</p>

<h4>1736.</h4>


<p>1. Two prints of Before and After. The two
pictures, from which these prints are taken, were
painted at the particular request of a certain vicious
nobleman, whose name deserves no commemoration.
The hero of them is said to have been designed for
Chief Justice <i>Willes. Hogarth</i> repented of having
engraved them; and almost every possessor of his
works will wish they had been with-held from the
public, as often as he is obliged to shew the volume
that contains them to ladies. To omit them, is to
mutilate the collection; to pin the leaves, on which
they are pasted, together, is a circumstance that tends
only to provoke curiosity; and to display them,
would be to set decency at defiance. The painter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
who indulges himself, or his employers, in such representations,
will forfeit the general praise he might
have gained by a choice of less offensive subjects.
We have an artist of no common merit, who has
frequently disgraced his skill by scenes too luxuriant
to appear in any situation but a brothel; and yet one
of the most meretricious of his performances, but a few
years ago, was exhibited by the Royal Academy.
These prints, however, display almost the only instance
in which <i>Hogarth</i> condescended to execute a subject
proposed to him; for I am assured by one who knew
him well, that his obstinacy on these occasions has
often proved invincible. Like <i>Shakspeare's Tully</i>,</p>

<blockquote><p>
"&mdash;&mdash;he would never follow any thing<br />
That other men began."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the later impressions from these plates, the
scroll-work on the head-cloth, &amp;c. of the bed, is
rendered indistinct, by an injudicious attempt to
strengthen the engraving. Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i> has the
first sketch in oil of "Before."<a name="FNanchor_1_195" id="FNanchor_1_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_195" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_195" id="Footnote_1_195"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_195"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The originals of both are at the earl of <i>Besborough's</i> seat
at <i>Roehampton</i>.</p><br /></div>


<p>2. The Sleeping Congregation. The preacher
was designed as the representative of Dr. <i>Desaguliers</i>.
This print was first published in 1736. It was afterwards
retouched and <i>improved</i><a name="FNanchor_1_196" id="FNanchor_1_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_196" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> by the author in
1762, and is found in three different states. In the
first, <i>Dieu &amp; Mon Droit</i> is wanting under the King's
Arms; the angel with one wing and two pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
thighs, that supports this motto, is smoking a pipe;
and the lion has not his present magnificent genitals.
In the second, the words already mentioned are
added; the angel's pipe is obliterated; the insignia
of the lion's sex rendered ostentatiously conspicuous;
and the lines of the triangle under the angel are
doubled. The other distinctions are chiefly such as a
reiteration of engraving would naturally produce, by
adding strength to the fainter parts of the composition.
Changes of this slender kind are numberless
in all the repaired prints of our artist. There is
also a pirated copy of this plate. It is not ill executed,
but in size is somewhat shorter than its predecessor,
and has no price annexed. In the original
picture, in the collection of Sir <i>Edward Walpole</i>,
the clerk's head is admirably well painted, and with
great force; but he is dozing, and not leering at
the young woman near him, as in the print.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_196" id="Footnote_1_196"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_196"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I wish, for the sake of some future edition of the present
work, these <i>improvements</i> could be ascertained. To me they
are invisible, like those in the re-published <i>March to Finchley</i>.</p><br /></div>

<p>3. The Distressed Poet.<a name="FNanchor_1_197" id="FNanchor_1_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_197" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In a back ground, a
picture of <i>Pope</i> threshing <i>Curll</i>. Over the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<i>Pope</i> we read, <i>Pope's Letters</i>; out of his mouth
comes <i>Veni, vidi, vici</i>; and under <i>Curll</i> lies a letter,
directed&mdash;<i>to Curll</i>. The distressed bard is composing
<i>Poverty</i>, a poem. At the bottom of the plate are
the following lines from <i>The Dunciad</i>, I. iii.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Studious he sate, with all his books around,<br />
Sinking from thought to thought, a vast profund!<br />
Plung'd for his sense, but found no bottom there;<br />
Then writ, and flounder'd on in mere despair.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the subsequent impressions, dated <i>December</i> 15,
1740, the triumphs of <i>Pope</i> are changed to a view
of the gold mines of <i>Peru</i>; and our hero of the
garret is employed in celebrating the praise of <i>Riches</i>.
The lines already quoted are effaced. The original
painting is at lord <i>Grosvenor's</i> house at <i>Milbank, Westminster</i>.</p>

called <i>Spot Ward</i>, from the left side of his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
being marked of a claret colour); and that of
the elder <i>Taylor</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_199" id="FNanchor_2_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_199" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a noted oculist, with an eye on
the head of his cane; Dr. <i>Pierce Dod</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_200" id="FNanchor_3_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_200" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Dr. <i>Bamber</i>;<a name="FNanchor_4_201" id="FNanchor_4_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_201" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and other physicians of that time. The
figure with a bone in its hand, between the two
demi-doctors (i. e. <i>Taylor</i> and <i>Ward</i>), is said to
have been designed for Mrs. <i>Mapp</i>, a famous masculine
woman, who was called the bone-setter, or
shape-mistress. I am told, that many of her advertisements
may be found in <i>Mist's Journal</i>, and
still more accounts of her cures in the periodical
publications of her time. Her maiden name was
<i>Wallin</i>. Her father was also a bone-setter at <i>Hindon,
Wilts</i>; but quarrelling with him, she wandered about
the country, calling herself <i>crazy Sally</i>. On her
success in her profession she married, <i>August</i> 11,
1736,<a name="FNanchor_5_202" id="FNanchor_5_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_202" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> one <i>Hill Mapp</i>, a servant to Mr. <i>Ibbetson</i>,
mercer on <i>Ludgate-Hill</i>. In most cases her success
was rather owing to the strength of her arms, and
the boldness of her undertakings, than to any knowledge
of anatomy or skill in chirurgical operations.
The following particulars relative to her are collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
from the <i>The Grub-street Journal</i>, &amp;c. and serve at
least to shew, that she was a character considerable
enough to deserve the satire of <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p><i>August</i> 19, 1736, "We hear that the husband of
Mrs. <i>Mapp</i>, the famous bone-setter at <i>Epsom</i>, ran
away from her last week, taking with him upwards
of 100 guineas, and such other portable
things as lay next hand."</p>

<p>"Several letters from <i>Epsom</i> mention, that the
footman, whom the female bone-setter married
the week before, had taken a sudden journey from
thence with what money his wife had earned; and
that her concern at first was very great: but soon
as the surprize was over, she grew gay, and
seemed to think the money well disposed of, as it
was like to rid her of a husband. He took just
102 guineas."</p>

<p>The following verses were addressed to her in
<i>August</i> 1736.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Of late, without the least pretence to skill,<br />
<i>Ward's</i> grown a fam'd physician by a pill;<a name="FNanchor_6_203" id="FNanchor_6_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_203" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br />

While envious Death oft blasts his rising fame.<br />
Next travell'd <i>Taylor</i> fill'd us with surprize,<br />
Who pours new light upon the blindest eyes;<br />
Each journal tells his circuit thro' the land;<br />
Each journal tells the blessings of his hand:<br />
And lest some hireling scribbler of the town<br />
Injures his history, he writes his own.<br />
We read the long accounts with wonder o'er;<br />
Had he wrote less, we had believ'd him more.<br />
Let these, O <i>Mapp!</i> thou wonder of the age!<br />
With dubious arts endeavour to engage:<br />
While you, irregularly strict to rules,<br />
Teach dull collegiate pedants they are fools:<br />
By merit, the sure path to fame pursue;<br />
For all who see thy art, must own it true."<br />

<p><i>September</i> 2, 1736, "On <i>Friday</i> several persons,
who had the misfortune of lameness, crowded to
<i>The White-hart Inn</i>, in <i>White-chapel</i>, on hearing
Mrs. <i>Mapp</i> the famous bone-setter was there.
Some of them were admitted to her, and were
relieved as they apprehended. But a gentleman,
who happened to come by, declared Mrs. <i>Mapp</i>
was at <i>Epsom</i>, on which the woman thought proper
to move off."</p>

<p><i>September</i> 9, 1736. "Advertisement.</p>

<p>"Whereas it has been industriously (I wish I
could say truly) reported, that I had found great
benefit from a certain female bone-setter's performance,
and that it was to a want of resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to undergo the operation, that I did not meet
with a perfect cure: this is therefore to give notice,
that any persons afflicted with lameness (who
are willing to know what good or harm others
may receive, before they venture on desperate
measures themselves) will be welcome any morning
to see the dressing of my leg, which was
sound before the operation, and they will then be
able to judge of the performance, and to whom I
owe my present unhappy confinement to my bed
and chair.</p>

<p><i>September</i> 16, 1736. "On <i>Thursday</i>, Mrs. <i>Mapp's</i>
plate of ten guineas was run for at <i>Epsom</i>. A
mare, called 'Mrs. <i>Mapp</i>,' won the first heat;
when Mrs. <i>Mapp</i> gave the rider a guinea, and swore
if he won the plate she would give him 100; but
the second and third heat was won by a chestnut
mare."</p>

returned, and has been kindly received."</p>

comedy called 'The Husband's Relief, with
the Female Bone-setter and Worm Doctor;' which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
occasioned a full house, and the following epigram:</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_198" id="Footnote_1_198"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_198"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>Joshua Ward</i> was one of the younger sons of an ancient
and respectable family settled at <i>Guisborough</i> in <i>Yorkshire</i>, where
he was born some time in the last century. He seems, from
every description of him, to have had small advantages from
education, though he indisputably possessed no mean natural
parts. The first account we have of him is, that he was a associated
in partnership with a brother named <i>William</i>, as a dry-salter,
in <i>Thames-street</i>. After they had carried on this business
some time, a fire broke out in an adjoining house, which
communicated itself to their warehouses, and entirely destroyed
all their property. On this occasion Mr. <i>Ward</i>, with a gentleman
from the country who was on a visit to him, escaped
over the tops of the houses in their shirts. In the year 1717
he was returned member for <i>Marlborough</i>; but, by a vote of the
House of Commons, dated <i>May</i> 13, was declared not duly
elected. It is imagined that he was in some measure connected
with his brother <i>John Ward</i> (who is stigmatized by Mr. <i>Pope</i>,
Dunciad III. 34.) in secreting and protecting illegally the property
of some of the <i>South Sea</i> directors. Be this as it may, he
soon after fled from <i>England</i>, resided some years abroad, and
has been frequently supposed to have turned <i>Roman</i> Catholic.
While he remained in exile, he acquired that knowledge of
medicine and chemistry, which afterwards was the means of
raising him to a state of affluence. About the year 1733 he
began to practise physic, and combated, for some time, the
united efforts of Wit, Learning, Argument, Ridicule, Malice,
and Jealousy, by all of which he was opposed in every shape
that can be suggested. At length, by some lucky cures, and particularly
one on a relation of Sir <i>Joseph Jekyl</i> Master of the
Rolls, he got the better of his opponents, and was suffered to
practise undisturbed. From this time his reputation was established:
he was exempted, by a vote of the House of Commons,
from being visited by the censors of the college of physicians,
and was even called in to the assistance of King <i>George</i>
the Second, whose hand he cured, and received, as a reward,
a commission for his nephew the late General <i>Gansel</i>. It was
his custom to distribute his medicines and advice, and even
pecuniary assistance, to the poor, at his house, <i>gratis</i>; and thus
he acquired considerable popularity. Indeed, in these particulars
his conduct was entitled to every degree of praise. With
a stern outside, and rough deportment, he was not wanting in
benevolence. After a continued series of success, he died <i>Dec.</i>
21, 1761, at a very advanced age, and left the secret of his
medicines to Mr. <i>Page</i>, member for <i>Chichester</i>, who bestowed
them on two charitable institutions, which have derived considerable
advantages from them. His will is printed in <i>The
Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1762, p. 208.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_199" id="Footnote_2_199"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_199"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> I was assured by the late Dr. <i>Johnson</i>, that <i>Ward</i> was the
weakest, and <i>Taylor</i> the most ignorant, of the whole empiric
tribe. The latter once asserted, that when he was at <i>St. Petersburg</i>,
he travelled as far as <i>Archangel</i> to meet Prince <i>Herculaneum</i>.
Now <i>Archangel</i> being the extreme point from <i>European
Asia</i>, had the tale been true, the oculist must have marched
so far backwards out of the route of Prince <i>Heraclius</i>, whose
name he had blundered into <i>Herculaneum</i>.
</p>
<p>
The present likeness of our oculist, however, we may suppose
to have been a strong one, as it much resembles a mezzotinto
by <i>Faber</i>, from a picture painted at <i>Rome</i> by the Chevalier
<i>Riche</i>. Under it is the following inscription: "<i>Joannes
Taylor</i>, Medicus in Optica expertissimus multisque in Academiis
celeberrimis Socius." Eight <i>Latin</i> verses follow,
which are not worth transcription. <i>Taylor</i> made presents of
this print to his friends. It is now become scarce.</p></div>

<p>I have been told, that Mr. <i>Garrick</i>, when he first
appeared in the character of <i>Bayes</i>, taking the same
liberty, received instantly such a message from one
of the stage boxes, as prevented him from practising
so insolent a stroke of mimickry a second time.</p>

<p>In spite of the confidence with which this plate has
been attributed to <i>Hogarth</i>, I by no means believe
it was his performance. It more resembles the
manner of <i>Vandergucht</i>, who was equally inclined
to personal satire, however his talents might be inadequate
to his purposes. Witness several scattered
designs of his in the very same style of engraving.
I may add, that he always exerted his talents in the
service of the Tory faction. Besides, there is nothing
in the plate before us which might not have
been expected from the hand of any common artist.
The conceit of the blasts issuing from the posteriors
of the <i>Æolian</i> tribe, is borrowed from one of the
prints to <i>Scarron's Travesty of Virgil</i>; and the figure
of <i>Britannia</i> is altogether insipid and unworthy of
<i>Hogarth</i>. Our artist also was too much accustomed
to sailing parties, and too accurate an observer of objects
on <i>The Thames</i>, not to have known that our
Royal Yachts are vessels without three masts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>1. The Four Parts of the Day.<a name="FNanchor_1_210" id="FNanchor_1_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_210" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>Invented, painted,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
<i>engraved, and published by W. Hogarth.</i> Mr. <i>Walpole</i>
observes that these plates, "except the last, are inferior
to few of his works." We have been told that
<i>Hogarth's</i> inclination to satire once cost him a legacy.
It seems that the figure of the Old Maid, in the print
of <i>Morning</i>, was taken either from an acquaintance
or relation of his. At first she was well enough satisfied
with her resemblance; but some designing people
teaching her to be angry, she struck the painter
out of her will, which had been made considerably in
his favour. This story we have heard often related
by those whom, on other occasions, we could readily
believe. In the same print is a portrait of Dr. <i>Rock</i>,
who formerly attended <i>Covent-Garden</i> market every
morning.</p>

<p>To the propriety of <i>Hogarth's</i> having introduced
a scene of riot within <i>King's Coffee-house</i>,
the following quotation from <i>The Weekly Miscellany</i>
for <i>June</i> 9, 1739, bears sufficient testimony: "<i>Monday</i>
Mrs. <i>Mary King</i> of <i>Covent-Garden</i> was brought
up to the King's Bench Bar at <i>Westminster</i>, and
received the following sentence, for keeping a disorderly
house; viz. to pay a fine of £.200, to suffer
three months imprisonment, to find security for
her good behaviour for three years, and to remain in
prison till the fine be paid." As it was impossible
she could carry on her former business, as soon as the
time of her imprisonment was ended, she retired
with her savings, built three houses on <i>Haverstock</i>
hill, near <i>Hampstead</i>, and died in one of them, <i>September</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
1747. Her own mansion was afterwards the
last residence of the celebrated <i>Nancy Dawson</i>;<a name="FNanchor_2_211" id="FNanchor_2_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_211" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
the three together are still distinguished by the appellation
of <i>Moll King's Row</i>. Perhaps the use of
the mirror in reversing objects was not yet understood
by our engravers, for in <i>Hogarth's</i> painting
the late Mr. <i>West's</i> house (now <i>Lowe's</i> Hotel) is properly
situated on the left of <i>Covent-garden</i> church.
In the print it appears on the contrary side.</p>

<p>The <i>Crying Boy</i> in <i>Noon</i> was sketched by <i>Hogarth</i>
from a picture by <i>N. Poussin</i> of the Rape
of the <i>Sabines</i>, at Mr. <i>Hoare's</i> at <i>Stourhead</i>. The
school boy's kite lodged on the roof of a building,
was introduced only to break the disagreeable uniformity
of a wall.</p>

<p>Our artist, in the scene of <i>Evening</i>, inserted the
little girl with the fan, as an after-thought, some
friend having asked him what the boy cried for. He
therefore introduced the girl going to take the play-thing
from her brother. Nothing is more common
than to see children cry without reason. The circumstance,
however, shews that this great Genius
did not always think himself above advice, as some
have alledged to have been the case with him. In
the early impressions of this plate, the face and neck
of the woman are coloured with red, to express heat;
and the hand of her husband is tinged with blue, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
intimate that he was by trade a <i>Dyer</i>. The purchasers
of the plate, intituled <i>Evening</i>, are hereby cautioned
against imposition. In a modern copy of it, sold to
the late Mr. <i>Ingham Foster</i>, the face of the woman
had been washed over with vermilion, that it might
pass (as it chanced to do) for a first impression. In
the true ones, and none but these, the face and bosom
were <i>printed</i> off with red, and the hand with
blue ink. Only the traces of the graver, therefore,
ought to be filled by either colour, and not the
whole surface of the visage, &amp;c. as in the smeary
counterfeit. I have been told that a few copies of
plate III. were taken off before the fan was inserted,
but have not hitherto met with one of them. In
<i>Night</i>, the drunken Free-mason has been supposed
to be Sir <i>Thomas de Veil</i>; but Sir <i>John Hawkins</i> assures
me, it is not the least like him. The <i>Salisbury
Flying-Coach</i> implies a satire on the right honourable
inventor of that species of carriage. The two first
of these pictures were sold to the Duke of <i>Ancaster</i>,
for 57 Guineas; the remaining pair to Sir <i>William
Heathcote</i> for 64.</p>

painted, engraved, and published by W. Hogarth</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes that this piece, "for wit and
imagination, without any other end," is the best of
all our artist's works. Mr. <i>Wood</i> of <i>Littelton</i> has the
original, for which he paid only 26 Guineas.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Trusler</i>, in his explanation of this plate, is of
opinion, that some incestuous commerce among the
performers is intimated by the names of <i>Oedipus</i> and
<i>Jocasta</i> appearing above the heads of two figures
among the theatrical lumber at the top of the barn.
But surely there is no cause for so gross a supposition.
Painted prodigies of this description were necessary
to the performance of <i>Lee's Oedipus</i>. See Act II.
where the following stage direction occurs; "The
cloud draws, that veiled the heads of the figures
in the sky, and shews them crowned, with the
names of <i>Oedipus</i> and <i>Jocasta</i> written above, in
great characters of gold." The magazine of dragons,
clouds, scenes, flags, &amp;c. or the woman half
naked, was sufficient to attract the notice of the rustick
peeping through the thatch he might be employed
to repair. Neither is the position of the figures
at all favourable to the Doctor's conceit. Incest
was also too shocking an idea to have intruded itself
among the comic circumstances that form the present
representation. When this plate was retouched a
second time, a variety of little changes were made in
it. In the two earliest impressions the actress who
personates <i>Flora</i>, is greasing her hair with a tallow
candle, and preparing to powder herself, after her
cap, feathers, &amp;c. were put on. This solecism in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
regular course of dress is removed in the third copy,
the cap and ornaments being there omitted. The
coiffure of the female who holds the cat, is also
lowered; and whereas at first we could read in the
play-bill depending from the truckle-bed, that the
part of <i>Jupiter</i> was to be performed by Mr. <i>Bilk-village</i>,
an additional shade in the modern copy renders
this part of the inscription illegible. Several holes
likewise in the thatch of the barn are filled up; and
the whole plate has lost somewhat of its clearness.
The same censure is due to the reparations of the
<i>Harlot's</i> and <i>Rake's Progresses</i>. Had <i>Hogarth</i> lived,
he would also have gradually destroyed much of
that history of dress, &amp;c. for which his designs have
been justly praised by Mr. <i>Walpole</i>. In the first and
last scenes of the <i>Rake's Progress</i>, he began to adorn
the heads of his females in the fashion prevalent at
the time he retraced the plates. In short, the collector,
who contents himself with the later impressions
of his work, will not consult our artist's reputation.
Those who wish to be acquainted with the whole
extent of his powers, should assemble the first copies,
together with all the varieties of his capital works.</p>

<h4>1741.</h4>


<p>1. The Enraged Musician, <i>Designed, engraved,
and published by W. Hogarth.</i> "Mr. <i>John Festin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_215" id="FNanchor_1_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_215" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the first hautboy and <i>German</i> flute of his time, had
numerous scholars, to each of whom he devoted
an hour every day. At nine in the morning he
attended Mr. <i>Spencer</i>, grandfather to the earl of
that name. If he happened to be out of town on
any day, he devoted that hour to another. One
morning at that hour he waited on Mr. <i>V&mdash;&mdash;n</i>, afterwards
Lord <i>V&mdash;&mdash;n</i>. He was not up. Mr. <i>Festin</i>
went into his chamber, and opening the shutter of
a window, sat down in it. The figure with the
hautboy was playing under the window. A man,
with a barrow full of onions, came up to the
player, and sat on the edge of his barrow, and
said to the man, 'if you will play the <i>Black Joke</i>,
I will give you this onion.' The man played it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
When he had so done, the man again desired him
to play some other tune, and then he would give
him another onion. 'This,' said <i>Festin</i> to me,
'highly angered me; I cried out, Z&mdash;&mdash;ds, sir,
stop here. This fellow is ridiculing my profession:
he is playing on the hautboy for onions.' Being
intimate with Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, he mentioned the circumstance
to him; which, as he said, was the
origin of 'The enraged Musician.' The fact may
be depended upon. Mr. <i>Festin</i><a name="FNanchor_2_216" id="FNanchor_2_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_216" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was himself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Enraged Performer." The story is here told just
as he related it to a clergyman, in whose words
the reader now receives it.</p>

<p>Of this print<a name="FNanchor_3_217" id="FNanchor_3_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_217" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> it has been quaintly said, that
it deafens one to look at it. Mr. <i>Walpole</i> is of
opinion that it "tends to farce." <i>Rouquet</i>
says of it, "Le Musicien est un <i>Italien</i> que les
cris de <i>Londres</i> font enrager." The wretched
figure playing on a hautbois, was at that time
well known about the streets. For variations, see
the horse's head, originally white, but now black.&mdash;Sleeve
of the child with a rattle, at first smaller,
as well as of a lighter hue&mdash;the milk-woman's face,
cloak, &amp;c. boy's dragg, cutler's hatchet, dog, &amp;c.
&amp;c. more darkened than in the first impressions.
These, however, can scarcely be termed varieties, as
they were occasioned only by retouching the plate,
and adding a few shadows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hogarth</i>, however, made several alterations and
additions in this plate when it appeared to be finished.
He changed in some measure all the countenances,
and indeed the entire head and limbs of the chimney-sweeper,
who had originally a grenadier's cap on.
Miss had also a <i>Doll</i>, significantly placed under the
trap composed of bricks, near which some sprigs
from a tree are set in the ground, the whole contrivance
being designed by some boy for the purpose of
taking birds; but when occupied by Miss's Play-thing,
became emblematic of the art of catching
men. What relates, however, to this young lady
from a boarding-school, was gross enough without
such an amplification. The play-bill, sow-gelder,
cats, dragg, &amp;c. were not introduced, nor the pewterer's
advertisement, nor the steeple in which the
ringers are supposed. It is remarkable that the
dustman was without a nose. The proofs of the
plate in this condition are scarce. I have seen only
one of them.<a name="FNanchor_4_218" id="FNanchor_4_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_218" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i> has the original

<p><a name="Footnote_2_216" id="Footnote_2_216"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_216"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In the second edition of these anecdotes, I had said "the
musician was undoubtedly <i>Castrucci</i>;" though one gentleman
assured me it was <i>Veracini</i>. The error is here acknowledged,
to shew the danger of receiving information upon trust. In
the first edition, I had fallen into a less pardonable mistake,
by supposing it was <i>Cervetto</i>, whom I described to be then
lately dead. But "<i>Hogarth's</i> musician," as a friend on that
occasion suggested to me, "is represented with a violin;
whereas <i>Cervetto's</i> instrument was the violoncello; but, however
that may be, he is now certainly living. He lodges at
<i>Friburg's</i> snuff-shop, in <i>The Haymarket</i>, and may be seen every
day at <i>The Orange Coffeehouse</i>, although he completed his 101st.
year in <i>November</i> 1781." This extraordinary character in
the musical world came to <i>England</i> in the hard frost, and was
then an old man. He soon after was engaged to play the bass
at <i>Drury-lane</i> theatre, and continued in that employment till
a season or two previous to Mr. <i>Garrick's</i> retiring from the
stage. He died <i>June</i> 14, 1783, in his 103d year. One evening
when Mr. <i>Garrick</i> was performing the character of Sir
<i>John Brute</i>, during the drunkard's muttering and dosing till
he falls fast asleep in the chair (the audience being most profoundly
silent and attentive to this admirable performer), <i>Cervetto</i>
(in the orchestra) uttered a very loud and immoderately-lengthened
yawn! The moment <i>Garrick</i> was off the stage, he
sent for the musician, and with considerable warmth reprimanded
him for so ill-timed a symptom of somnnolency, when
the modern <i>Naso</i>, with great address, reconciled <i>Garrick</i> to
him in a trice, by saying, with a shrug, "I beg ten tousand
pardon! but I alvays do so ven I am <i>ver much please</i>!" Mr.
<i>Cervetto</i> was distinguished among his friends in the galleries by
the name of <i>Nosey</i>. See <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1783, p. 95.</p></div>

prospect of a theatre. The openings between the
side scenes are crowded with applauding spectators.
The two performers are capering very high. A sun
over head (I suppose the emblem of public favour)
is darting down its rays upon them. The representatives
of Tragedy and Comedy are candle-holders
on the occasion. Underneath is the following inscription:
"The prick'd lines show the rising height."
There are also a few letters of direction, so situated
as to convey no very decent innuendo. The whole is
but a hasty outline, executed, however, with spirit,
and bitten uncommonly deep by the aqua fortis. I
ascribe it to <i>Hogarth</i> without hesitation. Of this print
there is a copy by <i>Livesay</i>.</p>

<p>All the three pieces of our artist that satirize the

with Mademoiselle <i>Roland</i> from <i>Paris</i> (this lady is still

to <i>Paris</i>, by order of Mr. <i>Fleetwood</i>, to engage Mademoiselle

<p>4. Taste in High Life. A beau, a fashionable old
lady, a young lady, a black boy, and a monkey.
Painted by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>. It was sold by Mr. <i>Jarvis</i>,
in <i>Bedford-street, Covent-Garden. Published May 24th,
[no year].</i> The original picture is in the possession
of Mr. <i>Birch</i>, surgeon, <i>Essex-street</i>, in <i>The Strand</i>.</p>

<p>It displays (as we learn from an inscription on the
pedestal under a <i>Venus</i> dressed in a hoop-petticoat)
the reigning modes of the year 1742. It was painted
for the opulent Miss <i>Edwards</i>, who paid our artist
sixty guineas for it. Her reason for choosing such a
subject was rather whimsical. By her own singularities
having incurred some ridicule, she was desirous,
by the assistance of <i>Hogarth</i>, to recriminate on the
publick. As he designed after her ideas, he had
little kindness for his performance, and never would
permit a print to be taken from it. The present one
was from a drawing made by connivance of her servants.
The original was purchased by the father of
its present owner, at her sale at <i>Kensington</i>.</p>

<p>The figure of the beau holding the china-saucer
is said to have been that of Lord <i>Portmore</i>, dressed
as he first appeared at court after his return from
<i>France</i>. The young female was designed for a celebrated
courtezan, who was the <i>Kitty Fisher</i> of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
time. Her familiarity with the black boy alludes to
a similar weakness in a noble duchess, who educated
two brats of the same colour. One of them afterwards
robbed her, and the other was guilty of some
offence equally unpardonable. The pictures with
which the room is adorned, contain many strokes of
temporary satire. See the <i>Venus</i> with stays, a hoop,
and high-heel'd shoes; <i>Cupid</i> burning all these parts
of dress, together with a modish wig, &amp;c.; a second
<i>Cupid</i> paring down a plump lady to the fashionable
standard; and [in a framed picture classed with a
number of insects] the figure of <i>Desnoyer</i> the dancing-master
in a grand ballet. The ridicule on the folly
of collecting old china, &amp;c. &amp;c. are alike circumstances
happily introduced, and explanatory of the
fashions then in vogue. The colouring is better than
that in most of <i>Hogarth's</i> pictures. The plate is now
the property of Mr. <i>Sayer</i>.</p>

his life as master of a vessel trading to our colonies. While
he resided in that part of the metropolis which is the common
residence of seafaring people, business often obliging him to
come early into the city and return late; he had frequent
occasions of seeing young children exposed, through the indigence
or cruelty of their parents. This excited his compassion
so far, that he projected <i>The Foundling Hospital</i>; in
which humane design he laboured 17 years, and at last, by
his sole application, obtained the royal charter for it.<a name="FNanchor_A_223" id="FNanchor_A_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_223" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> He

<p>1. Marriage à la Mode.<a name="FNanchor_1_224" id="FNanchor_1_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_224" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Six plates. In 1746<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
was published, "Marriage à la Mode: an Humourous
Tale, in Six Canto's, in Hudibrastic Verse;
being an Explanation of the Six Prints lately published
by the ingenious Mr. <i>Hogarth. London</i>:
printed for <i>Weaver Bickerton</i>, in <i>Temple-Exchange
Passage</i>, in <i>Fleet-Street</i>, 1746. Price One Shilling."
Of this pamphlet it will be sufficient to extract the
Preface and the arguments of the several Canto's;
the poem itself (if such it may be called) being extended
to the length of 59 pages.</p>

<p>"The prints of Marriage à la Mode, being the
latest production of that celebrated Artist who had
before obliged the town with several entertaining
pieces, have, ever since their publication, been
very justly admired; the particular vein of humour,
that runs through the whole of his works,
is more especially preserved in this.</p>

<p>"If the Comic Poet who draws the characters of
the age he lives in, by keeping strictly up to their
manners in their speeches and expressions; if satirizing
vice and encouraging virtue in dialogue,
to render it familiar, is always reckoned amongst
the liberal arts; and the authors, when dead, dignified
with busts and monuments sacred to their
memory; sure the master of the pencil, whose
traits carry, not only a lively image of the persons
and manners, but whose happy genius has found
the secret of so disposing the several parts, as to
convey a pleasing and instructive moral through
the history he represents, may claim a rank in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
foremost class, and acquire, if the term is allowable,
the appellation of the Dramatic Painter.</p>

<p>"The Modish Husband, incapable of relishing the
pleasures of true happiness, is here depicted in his
full swing of vice, 'till his mistaken conduct drives
his wife to be false to his bed, and brings him to
a wretched end; killed in revenging the loss of
that virtue which he would never cherish. The
Lady is equally represented as a true copy of all
the fine ladies of the age, who, by indulging their
passions, run into all those extravagances, that at
last occasion a shameful exit. If the gentlemen of
the long robe, who ought to know the consequences,
are guilty of committing such a breach
of hospitality as is here described, they are properly
reprimanded: the penurious Alderman,
and the profligate old Nobleman, are a fine contrast;
the Quack Doctor, the <i>Italian</i> Singer, &amp;c. are
proofs of the Inventor's judgement and distinction,
both in high and low life.</p>

<p>"Though these images are pleasing to the eye,
yet many have complained that they wanted
a proper explanation, which we hope will plead
an excuse for publication of the following Canto's,
as the desire to render these pieces more extensive
may atone for the many faults contained in this
poem, for which the <i>Hudibrastic</i> style was thought
most proper."</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>In these plates only a single variation is detected.
In the very first impressions of the second of them
(perhaps a few only were taken off) a lock of hair
on the forehead of the lady is wanting. It was
added by our artist, after <i>Baron</i> had finished the
plate. In the early copies he inserted it with <i>Indian</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
ink. A passage in the <i>Analysis</i><a name="FNanchor_2_225" id="FNanchor_2_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_225" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> will perhaps account
for this supplemental ornament: "A lock
of hair falling cross the temples, and by that
means breaking the regularity of the oval, has an
effect too alluring to be strictly decent." The
room represented in this plate is adorned with a
<i>melange</i> of pictures on wanton and devotional subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole</i> has remarked, that the works of <i>Hogarth</i>
have little obscurity. This position is true in
general, though <i>Marriage à la Mode</i> may supply an
exception to it; no two persons, perhaps, having
hitherto agreed in their explanation of Plate the
third.<a name="FNanchor_3_226" id="FNanchor_3_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_226" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>When this set of plates was to be engraved, <i>Ravenet</i>,
a young artist, then just coming into employ,
was recommended to Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>; and a hard bargain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
was made. <i>Ravenet</i> went through two of the
plates, but the price proved far inadequate to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
labour. He remonstrated, but could obtain no augmentation.
When the <i>Sigismunda</i> was to be engraved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Mr. <i>Ravenet</i> was in a different sphere of life.
The painter, with many compliments, solicited his
assistance as an engraver, but <i>Ravenet</i> indignantly
declined the connexion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>In the fourth of these plates<a name="FNanchor_4_228" id="FNanchor_4_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_228" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> are the following
portraits: Mrs. <i>Lane</i> (afterwards Lady <i>Bingley</i>)
adoring <i>Carestini</i>; her husband <i>Fox Lane</i> asleep.
<i>Rouquet</i> only calls him "Un gentilhomme campagnard,
fatigué d'une course après quelque renard
ou quelque cerf, s'endort." This idea seems to be
countenanced by the whip in his hand. The same
explainer adds, speaking of the two next figures,
"Ici on voit en papillotes un de ces personages qui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
passent toute leur vie à tâcher de plaire sans y
reüssir; la, un eventail au poing, on reconnoît un
de ces hérétiques en amour, un sectateur d'<i>Anacreon</i>."
The former of these has been supposed to
represent Monsieur <i>Michel</i>, the <i>Prussian</i> ambassador.
<i>Weideman</i> is playing on the <i>German</i> flute.&mdash;The pictures
in the room are properly suited to the bed-chamber
of a profligate pair&mdash;<i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Io, Lot</i>
with his Daughters, <i>Ganymede</i> and the Eagle, and
the Young Lawyer who debauches the Countess.
The child's coral, hanging from the back of the
chair she sits in, serves to shew she was already a mother;
a circumstance that renders her conduct still
more unpardonable. Some of her new-made purchases,
exposed on the floor, bear witness to the
warmth of her inclinations. These will soon be gratified
at the fatal masquerade, for which her paramour
is offering her a ticket.</p>

<p>The pompous picture on the right hand of the
window in the nobleman's apartment, Plate I. also
deserves attention. It appears to be designed as a
ridicule on the unmeaning flutter of <i>French</i> portraits,
some of which (particularly those of <i>Louis</i> XIV.) are
painted in a style of extravagance equal at least to
the present parody by <i>Hogarth</i>. This ancestor of our
peer is invested with several foreign orders. At the
top of one corner of the canvas, are two winds
blowing across each other, while the hero's drapery
is flying quite contrary directions. A comet is likewise
streaming over his head. In his hand he grasps
the lightning of <i>Jove</i>, and reposes on a cannon going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
off, whose ball is absurdly rendered an object of sight.
A smile, compounded of self-complacency and pertness,
is the characteristic of his face.</p>

<p>On the cieling of this magnificent saloon is a representation
of <i>Pharaoh</i> and his Host drowned in the
Red Sea. The pictures underneath are not on the
most captivating subjects&mdash;<i>David</i> killing <i>Goliath&mdash;Prometheus</i>
and the Vulture&mdash;the Murder of the <i>Innocents&mdash;Judith</i>
and <i>Holofernes</i>&mdash;St. <i>Sebastian</i> shot full
of Arrows&mdash;<i>Cain</i> destroying <i>Abel</i>&mdash;and St. <i>Laurence</i>
on the Gridiron.</p>

<p>Among such little circumstances in this plate as
might escape the notice of a careless spectator, is the
Thief in the Candle, emblematic of the mortgage
on his Lordship's estate.</p>

<p>When engravings on a contracted scale are made
from large pictures, a few parts of them will unavoidably
become so small, as almost to want distinctness.
It has fared thus with a number of figures
that appear before the unfinished edifice,<a name="FNanchor_5_229" id="FNanchor_5_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_229" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> seen
through a window in the first plate of this work.
<i>Hogarth</i> designed them for the lazy vermin of his
Lordship's hall, who, having nothing to do, are sitting
on the blocks of stone, or staring at the building;<a name="FNanchor_6_230" id="FNanchor_6_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_230" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
for thus <i>Rouquet</i> has described them, "Une
troupe de lacquais oisifs, qui sont dans le cour de
ce batiment, acheve de caracteriser le faste ruineux
qui environne le comte." The same illustrator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
properly calls the <i>Citizen</i> Echevin (i. e. sheriff) of
<i>London</i>, on account of the chain he wears.</p>

<p>Plate II. From the late Dr. <i>Ducarel</i> I received
the following anecdote; but there must be some
mistake in it, as <i>Herring</i> was not archbishop till several
years after the designs for <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>
were made.</p>

<p>"<i>Edward Swallow</i>, butler to Archbishop <i>Herring</i>,
had an annuity of ten pounds given to him in his
Grace's will. For the honesty and simplicity of
his physiognomy, this old faithful servant was so
remarkable, that <i>Hogarth</i>, wanting such a figure in
<i>Marriage à la Mode</i>, accompanied the late dean of
<i>Sarum</i>, Dr. <i>Thomas Greene</i>, on a public day, to
<i>Lambeth</i>, on purpose to catch the likeness. As
they were coming away, he whispered, 'I have
him!' And he may now be seen to the life preserved
in the old steward, in Plate II. with his hands
held up, &amp;c."</p>

<p>In Plate V. the back ground, which is laboured
with uncommon delicacy (a circumstance that will
be remarked by few except artists), was the work of
Mr. <i>Ravenet's</i> wife. <i>Solomon's</i> wise judgement is represented
on the tapestry. When <i>Ravenet's</i> two plates
were finished, <i>Hogarth</i> wanted much to retouch the
faces,<a name="FNanchor_7_231" id="FNanchor_7_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_231" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and many disputes happened between him
and the engraver on this subject. The first impressions,
however, escaped without correction. Those
who possess both copies, may discover evident marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
of <i>Hogarth's</i> hand in the second. See particularly
the countenance of the dying nobleman, which is
fairly ploughed up by his heavier burin.</p>

<p>I have been told that our artist took the portrait
of the female, who is so placed, that the legs of a
figure in the tapestry supply the want of her own,
from a coarse picture of a woman called <i>Moll Flanders</i>.</p>

<p>Plate the sixth of this set, affords <i>Rouquet</i> an opportunity
of illustrating the following remark, which
he had made at the outset of his undertaking: "Ce
qu'un <i>Anglois</i> lit, pour ainsi dire, en jettant les
yeux sur ces estampes, va exiger de vous la lecture
de plusieurs pages." Speaking of our citizen's parsimony,
says he&mdash;"Voyez-vous ces pipes conservées
dans le coin d'un armoire? Vous ne devineriez
pas, vous qui n'êtes pas jamais venu en <i>Angleterre</i>,
qu'elles sont aussi une marque d'economie;
mais il faut vous dire que les pipes sont si
communes ici, qu'on ne fume jamais deux fois
dans la même. La païsan, l'artizan le plus vil
prend une pipe gratis dans le premier cabaret où
il arrête: il continue son chemin en achevant de
la fumer, et la jette à ses pieds."</p>

<p>As <i>Rouquet</i> observes, "Ce qui sert à garnir cet
apartement ne contribue pas à l'orner. Tout y
indique une économie basse." The scarcity of the
real dinner&mdash;the picture exhibiting plenty of provision&mdash;the
starved dog&mdash;the departing physician&mdash;the
infected and ricketty condition of the child who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
brought to take a last kiss of its dying mother&mdash;are
circumstances too striking to be overlooked.</p>

<p><i>The Daily Advertiser</i> of 1750 affords the following
illustration of our artist's history: "Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>
proposes to publish by subscription two large
prints, one representing <i>Moses</i> brought to <i>Pharaoh's</i>
daughter; the other <i>Paul</i> before <i>Felix</i>; engraved
after the pictures of his painting which are now
hung up in <i>The Foundling Hospital</i> and <i>Lincoln's-Inn
Hall</i>. Five Shillings to be paid at the time of
subscribing, and Five Shillings more on the delivery
of the print. On the first payment a receipt
will be given, which receipt will contain a new
print (in the true <i>Dutch</i> taste) of <i>Paul</i> before <i>Felix</i>.
Note, The above two prints will be Seven Shillings
and Six Pence each after the subscription is over;
and the receipt-print will not be sold at a less price
than One Guinea each. Subscriptions are taken in
till the 6th of <i>June</i> next, and no longer, at <i>The
Golden-Head</i> in <i>Leicester-Fields</i>, where the drawings
may be seen; as likewise the author's six pictures
of <i>Marriage-à-la-Mode</i>, which are to be disposed of
in the following manner: That every bidder sign
a note with the sum he intends to give. That such
note be deposited in the drawer of a cabinet, which
cabinet shall be constantly kept locked by the said
<i>William Hogarth</i>; and in the cabinet, through a
glass door, the sums bid will be seen on the face
of the drawer, but the names of the bidders may
be concealed till the time of bidding shall be expired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
That each bidder may, by a fresh note,
advance a further sum if he is outbid, of which
notice shall be sent him. That the sum so advanced
shall not be less than Three Guineas. That
the time of bidding shall continue till twelve
o'clock the 6th of <i>June</i> next, and no longer. That
no dealer in pictures will be admitted a bidder.</p>

<p>"As (according to the standard of judgement, so
righteously and laudably established by picture-dealers,
picture-cleaners, picture-frame-makers,
and other connoisseurs) the works of a painter are
to be esteemed more or less valuable as they are
more or less scarce, and as the living painter is
most of all affected by the inferences resulting from
this and other considerations equally uncandid and
edifying; Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, by way of precaution, not
puff, begs leave to urge, that, probably, this will
be the last suit or series of pictures he may ever exhibit,
because of the difficulty of vending such a
number at once to any tolerable advantage, and
that the whole number he has already exhibited of
the historical or humourous kind does not exceed
fifty, of which the three sets called <i>The Harlot's
Progress, The Rake's Progress,</i> and that now to be
sold, make twenty; so that whoever has a taste of
his own to rely on, not too squeamish for the production
of a Modern, and courage enough to own
it, by daring to give them a place in his collection
(till Time, the supposed finisher, but real designer
of paintings, has rendered them fit for those more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
sacred repositories where Schools, Names, Heads,
Masters, &amp;c. attain their last stage of preferment),
may from hence be convinced that multiplicity at
least of his (Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i>) pieces will be no diminution
of their value."</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Lane</i>, of <i>Hillingdon</i> near <i>Uxbridge</i>, bought the
six original pictures for 120 guineas, at <i>Hogarth's</i>
auction.<a name="FNanchor_8_232" id="FNanchor_8_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_232" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_226" id="Footnote_3_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_226"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In the third plate of this work, the figure of the female
unclasping a penknife, is said to have been designed for the
once celebrated <i>Betty Careless</i>. This remark is supposed to be
countenanced by the initials E. C. on her bosom. From being
in a state to receive company, this woman had been long reduced
to show it, and, after repeated confinements in various
prisons, was buried from the poor's house of St. <i>Paul, Covent
Garden, April</i> 22, 1752, about seven years after this set of
prints had been published. Such a representation of her decline
from beauty, as may be given in the plate before us, is
justified by various passages in <i>Loveling's</i> poems, <i>Latin</i> and
<i>English</i>, written about the year 1738, and published in 1741.
Thus in his ode, "Ad <i>Sextum</i>,"

<p>
These lines will serve to enforce the moral of <i>The Harlot's
Progress</i>, while they aim at the illustration of a single circumstance
in <i>Marriage à&nbsp;la Mode</i>; where if this female is introduced
at all, it seems to be in the character of an opulent
procuress, either threatening the peer for having diseased her
favourite girl, or preparing to revenge herself on the quack
whose medicines had failed to eradicate his lordship's disorder.
That heroine must have been notorious, who could at once engage
the pencil of <i>Hogarth</i> and the pens of <i>Loveling</i> and
<i>Fielding</i>, who in the sixth chapter of the first book of <i>Amelia</i>
has the following story: "I happened in my youth to sit behind
two ladies in a side-box at a play, where, in the balcony
on the opposite side was placed the inimitable <i>Betty
Careless</i>, in company with a young fellow of no very formal,
or indeed sober, appearance. One of the ladies, I remember,
said to the other&mdash;'Did you ever see any thing look
so modest and so innocent as that girl over the way? What
pity it is such a creature should be in the way of ruin, as I
am afraid she is, by her being alone with that young fellow!'
Now this lady was no bad physiognomist; for it was impossible
to conceive a greater appearance of modesty, innocence,
and simplicity, than what nature had displayed in the countenance
of that girl; and yet, all appearances notwithstanding,
I myself (remember, critic, it was in my youth)
had a few mornings before seen that very identical picture
of those engaging qualities in bed with a rake at a bagnio,
smoaking tobacco, drinking punch, talking obscenity, and
swearing and cursing with all the impudence and impiety of
the lowest and most abandoned trull of a soldier." We may
add, that one of the mad-men in the last plate of <i>The Rake's
Progress</i> has likewise written "charming <i>Betty Careless"</i> on
the rail of the stairs, and wears her portrait round his neck.
Perhaps between the publication of <i>The Rake's Progress</i> and
<i>Marriage à&nbsp;la Mode</i>, she sunk from a wanton into a bawd.
Mrs. <i>Heywood's Betsey Thoughtless</i> was at first entitled <i>Betsey
Careless</i>, but the name was afterwards changed for obvious
reasons.
</p>
<p>
<i>The London Daily Post, Nov.</i> 28, 1735, contains the following
advertisement from this notorious female:
</p>
<p>
"Mrs. <i>Careless</i>, from the <i>Piazza</i> in <i>Covent-Garden</i>, not being
able to make an end of her affairs so soon as she expected,
intends on <i>Monday</i> next to open a coffee-house in
<i>Prujean's-Court</i>, in <i>The Old Bailey</i>, where she hopes her friends
will favour her with their company, notwithstanding the ill
situation of the place; since her misfortunes oblige her still
to remain there.
</p>
<p>
"N. B. It is the uppermost house in the court, and coaches
and chairs may come up to the door."
</p>
<p>
Again in <i>The London Daily Post, Oct.</i> 21, 1741, Mrs. <i>Careless</i>
advertises <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>, at the theatre in <i>James-Street,
Haymarket</i>, for her benefit, <i>Oct.</i> 27. At the bottom of the
advertisement she says, "Mrs. <i>Careless</i> takes this benefit because
she finds a small pressing occasion for one: and as she
has the happiness of knowing she has a great many friends,
hopes not to find an instance to the contrary by their being
absent the above-mentioned evening; and as it would be
entirely inconvenient, and consequently disagreeable, if they
should, she ventures to believe they won't fail to let her
have the honour of their company." In the bill of the day
she says&mdash;"N. B. Mrs. <i>Careless</i> hopes her friends will favour
her according to their promise, to relieve her from terrible
fits of the vapours proceeding from bad dreams, though the
comfort is they generally go by the contraries.
</p>
<p>
"Tickets to be had at Mrs. <i>Careless's</i> Coffee-house, the
<i>Playhouse-Passage, Bridges-Street</i>."
</p>
<p>
Would the public, at this period of refinement, have patiently
endured the familiar address of such a shameless, superannuated,
advertising strumpet?
</p>
<p>
The reader will perhaps smile, when, after so much grave
ratiocination, and this long deduction of particulars, he is
informed that the letters are not E. C. but F. C. the initials
of <i>Fanny Cock</i>, daughter to the celebrated auctioneer of that
name, with whom our artist had had some casual disagreement.
</p>
<p>
The following, somewhat different, explanation has also been
communicated to me by <i>Charles Rogers</i>, esq. who says it came
from <i>Sullivan</i>, one of <i>Hogarth's</i> engravers: "The nobleman
threatens to cane a quack-doctor for having given pills which
proved ineffectual in curing a girl he had debauched; and
brings with him a woman, from whom he alledges he caught
the infection; at which she, in a rage, is preparing to stab
him with her clasp knife. This wretch is one of the lowest
class, as is manifest by the letters of her name marked with
gunpowder on her breast. She, however, is brought to the
<i>French</i> barber-surgeon for his examination and inspection,
and for which purpose he is wiping his spectacles with his
coarse muckender."
</p>
<p>
The explanation given by <i>Rouquet</i>, however, ought not to
be suppressed, as in all probability he received it from <i>Hogarth</i>.
"Il falloit indiquer la mauvaise conduite du héros de la piece.
L'auteur pour cet effet l'introduit dans l'appartement d'un
empirique, où il ne peut guères se trouver qu'en consequence
de ses débauches; il fait en même tems rencontrer chez cet
empirique une de ces femmes qui perdues depuis long-tems,
font enfin leur métier de la perte des autres. Il suppose un
démêlé entre cette femme et son héros, dont le sujet paroît
être la mauvaise santé d'un petite fille, du commerce de laquelle
il ne s'est pas bien trouvé. La petite fille au reste
fait ici contraste par son âge, sa timidité, sa douceur, avec
le caractère de l'autre femme, qui paroît un composé de
rage, de fureur, et de tous les crimes qui accompagnent
d'ordinaire les dernières débauches chez celles de son sexe.
</p>
<p>

épisodiques. Quoique jadis barbier,<a name="FNanchor_A_227" id="FNanchor_A_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_227" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> il est aujourdhui,

L'auteur pour achever de le caracteriser suivant son
idée, lui fait inventer des machines extrèmement composées

un membre disloqué, ou de déboucher une bouteille.

<p>
"Je ne deciderai pas si l'auteur est aussi heureux dans le
choix des objets de sa satire, quand il les prend parmi nous,
que lorsqu'il les choisit parmi ceux de sa nation; mais il

que cette planche vous en paroîtra un exemple bien marqué.

concerning the sale of the original pictures of <i>Marriage-à-la-mode</i>,
being somewhat erroneous, I am happy in the present
opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to Mr. <i>Lane</i>
abovementioned, who has corrected my mistakes by a communication
of the following particulars relative to the purchase:
</p>
<p>
"Some time after they had been finished, perhaps six or
seven years, during which period Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> had been
preparing and publishing prints from them, in the year
1750 he advertised the sale of the originals by a kind of
auction not carried on by personal bidding, but by a written
ticket on which every one was to put the price he would
give, with his name subscribed to it. These papers were to
be received by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> for the space of one month; and
the highest bidder, at twelve o'clock on the last day of the
month, was to be the purchaser: and none but those who
had in writing made their biddings were to be admitted on
the day that was to determine the sale. This nouvelle method
of proceeding probably disobliged the public; and
there seemed to be at that time a combination against poor
<i>Hogarth</i>, who perhaps, from the extraordinary and frequent
approbation of his works, might have imbibed some degree
of vanity, which the town in general, friends and foes,
seemed resolved to mortify. If this was the case (and to
me it is very apparent), they fully effected their design; for
on the memorable sixth of <i>June</i> 1750, which was to decide
the fate of this capital work, about eleven o'clock Mr. <i>Lane</i>,
the fortunate purchaser, arrived at the <i>Golden Head</i>: when,
to his great surprize, expecting (what he had been a witness
to in 1745, when <i>Hogarth</i> disposed of many of his pictures)
to have found his painting-room full of noble and great personages,
he only found the painter and his ingenious friend
Dr. <i>Parsons</i>, secretary to the Royal Society, talking together,
and expecting a number of spectators at least, if not of
buyers. Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> then produced the highest bidding,
from a gentleman well known, of £120. Nobody coming
in, about ten minutes before twelve, by the decisive clock in
the room, Mr. <i>Lane</i> told Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> he would make the
pounds guineas. The clock then struck twelve, and <i>Hogarth</i>
wished Mr. <i>Lane</i> joy of his purchase, hoping it was
an agreeable one. Mr. <i>Lane</i> answered, Perfectly so. Now
followed a scene of disturbance from <i>Hogarth's</i> friend the
Doctor, and, what more affected Mr. <i>Lane</i>, a great appearance
of disappointment in the painter, and truly with
great reason. The Doctor told him, he had hurt himself
greatly by fixing the determination of the sale at so early an
hour, when the people at that part of the town were hardly
up. <i>Hogarth</i>, in a tone and manner that could not escape
observation, said, Perhaps it may be so! Mr. <i>Lane</i>, after a
short pause, declared himself to be of the same opinion,
adding, that the artist was very poorly rewarded for his labour,
and, if he thought it would be of service to him,
would give him till three o'clock to find a better purchaser.
<i>Hogarth</i> warmly accepted the offer, and expressed his acknowledgements
for the kindness in the strongest terms.
The proposal likewise received great encomiums from the
Doctor, who proposed to make it public. This was peremptorily
forbidden by Mr. <i>Lane</i>, whose concession in favour
of our artist was remembered by him to the time of
his death.&mdash;About one o'clock, two hours sooner than the
time appointed by Mr. <i>Lane, Hogarth</i> said he would no longer
trespass on his generosity, but that, if he was pleased with
his purchase, he himself was abundantly so with the purchaser.
He then desired Mr. <i>Lane</i> to promise that he would
not dispose of the pictures without previously acquainting
him of his intention, and that he would never permit any
person, under pretence of cleaning, to meddle with them,
as he always desired to take that office on himself. This
promise was readily made by Mr. <i>Lane</i>, who has been tempted
more than once by <i>Hogarth</i> to part with his bargain at a
price to be named by himself. When Mr. <i>Lane</i> bought the
pictures, they were in Carlo Marratt frames which cost the
painter four guineas apiece."
</p>
<p>
The memory of this occurrence ought always to attend the
work which afforded Mr. <i>Lane</i> an opportunity of displaying
so much disinterested generosity.
</p>
<p>
Another correspondent begins the same story as follows&mdash;A
little time before the auction, <i>Hogarth</i> publickly declared,
that no picture-dealer should be allowed to bid. He also called
on his friends, requesting them not to appear at the sale, as
his house was small, and the room might be over crowded.
They obeyed his injunctions. Early in this mortifying day he
dressed himself, put on his tye-wig, strutted away one hour,
and fretted away two more, no bidder appearing, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p><br /></div>

plate called <i>The Battle of the Pictures</i> is written,
"The bearer hereof is entitled (if he thinks proper)
to be a bidder for Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> pictures, which
are to be sold on the last day of this month [<i>February</i>,

the <i>White-Hart</i>, at <i>St. Alban's</i>) in the attitude of relating
on his fingers the numbers of the rebel forces.&mdash;"Such
a general had so many men, &amp;c." and remarked,
that the muscles of <i>Lovat's</i> neck appeared
of unusual strength, more so than he had ever seen.
When the painter entered the room, his lordship,
being under the barber's hands, received his old
friend with a salute, which left much of the lather
on his face.&mdash;The second impressions are marked,
<i>Price One Shilling</i>. When <i>Hogarth</i> had finished this
plate, a printseller offered its weight in gold for it.
The impressions could not be taken off so fast as they
were wanted, though the rolling-press was at work all
night for a week together. For several weeks afterwards
he is said to have received at the rate of 12 <i>l.</i>
per day.</p>

the last Chieftains that preserved the rude manners and barbarous
authority of the early feudal ages. He resided in a
house which would be esteemed but an indifferent one for a
very private, plain country gentleman in <i>England</i>; as it
had, properly, only four rooms on a floor, and those not
large. Here, however, he kept a sort of court, and several
public tables; and had a numerous body of retainers always
attending. His own constant residence, and the place where
he received company, even at dinner, was in the very same
room where he lodged; and his lady's sole apartment was
her bed-room; and the only provision for the lodging of the
servants, and retainers, was a quantity of straw, which they
spread every night, on the floors of the lower rooms, where
the whole inferior part of the family, consisting of a very
great number of persons, took up their abode." See Mr.
<i>King's</i> observations on ancient Castles, in the <i>Archæologia</i>,
vol. IV.
</p>
<p>
Sir <i>William Young</i>, one of the managers appointed by the
Commons of <i>Great Britain</i>, for conducting the prosecution
against this Nobleman for High Treason, in the year 1745,
makes the following observation: "Your Lordships have already
done national justice on some of the principal traitors,
who appeared in open arms against his Majesty, by the ordinary
course of law; but this noble Lord, who, in the
whole course of his life, has boasted of his superior cunning
in wickedness, and his ability to commit frequent treasons
with impunity, vainly imagined that he might possibly be a
traitor in private, and rebel only in his heart, by sending
his son and his followers to join the Pretender, and remaining
at home himself, to endeavour to deceive his Majesty's
faithful subjects; hoping <i>he</i> might be rewarded for his son's
services, if successful; or his <i>son</i> alone be the sufferer for
<i>his</i> offences, if the undertaking failed: diabolical cunning!
monstrous impiety!" See <i>State Trials</i>, vol. IX. p. 627.</p><br /></div>

and C. Grignion.</i> The late Mr. <i>Duncombe</i>, of <i>Duncombe
Park</i> in <i>Yorkshire</i>, gave 200 <i>l.</i> for the original
picture, which is now in the possession of his family.
The expression of the countenance is happily hit off,
but the figure is abundantly too large and muscular.
This print was afterwards, by <i>Hogarth's</i> permission,
copied for a watch-paper.</p>

<p>1. Stage-coach. An election procession in the
yard. <i>Designed and engraved by William Hogarth.</i>
In this plate there is a variation. The early impressions
have a flag behind the wheel of the coach,
inscribed <span class="smcap">no old baby</span>, which was the cry used by
the opponents of the honourable <i>John Child Tylney</i>
(then Viscount <i>Castlemain</i> and now Earl <i>Tylney</i><a name="FNanchor_1_235" id="FNanchor_1_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_235" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>)
when he stood member for the county of <i>Essex</i>, against
Sir <i>Robert Abdy</i> and Mr. <i>Bramston</i>. The figure still
carries a horn-book, and a rattle in its hands. At the
election, a man was placed on a bulk with an <i>infant</i>
in his arms, and exclaimed, as he whipt the child,
"What, you little <i>Child</i>, must you be a member?"
The family name was changed from <i>Child</i> to <i>Tylney</i>
by an act of parliament in 1735. In this disputed
election, it appeared from the register-book of the
parish where Lord <i>Castlemain</i> was born, that he was
but 20 years of age. Some pains have been taken
to ascertain the particular inn-yard in which the
scene is laid, but without success, so many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>

written under the sign, instead of "<i>West</i> and <i>Goodchild</i>."
<i>Hogarth</i> had inadvertently placed the name
of the junior partner first. Some mercantile friend,
however, pointing out the mistake, when as yet only
a few copies were taken off, our artist corrected it,
to avoid the criticisms of <i>Cheapside</i> and <i>Cornhill</i>. In
this plate is a figure of <i>Philip in the Tub</i>, a well-known
beggar and cripple, who was a constant epithalamist
at weddings in <i>London</i>, and had visited <i>Ireland</i>
and <i>The Seven Provinces</i>. The <i>French</i> clergyman
in Plate VIII. was designed for Mr. <i>Platell</i>, curate
of <i>Barnet</i>. Plate XI. The scene is in a cellar
of a noted house that went by the name of "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Blood Bowl House," from the various scenes of
blood that were there almost daily exhibited, and
where there seldom passed a month without the commission
of a murder. <i>Blood Bowl-alley</i> is down by
the fishmonger's, near <i>Water-lane, Fleet-street</i>; and I
am assured, that the house and event, that gave rise
to the name, were there. In Plate XI. is <i>Tiddy Doll</i>,
the well-known vender of gingerbread. Just behind
him, in a cart, to bring away the body of the criminal,
is his mother. Though her face is concealed, she
is distinguished by her excess of sorrow, and the
black hood she has worn throughout the foregoing
representations of her. Plate XII. <i>Frederick</i> Prince
of <i>Wales</i>, and the Princess of <i>Wales</i>, in the balcony.
The standards of the Blacksmiths' and Stationers'
Companies appear in the procession. The flag, at the
corner of one of the stands, belongs to the Pinners
and Needlers. The hint for this series of prints was
evidently taken from the old comedy of <i>Eastward-hoe</i>,
by <i>Jonson, Chapman,</i> and <i>Marston</i>, reprinted in
<i>Dodsley's</i> Collection of Old Plays. "The scenes of
<i>Bedlam</i> and the gaming-house," as Mr. <i>Walpole</i> well
observes, "are inimitable representations of our serious
follies, or unavoidable woes; and the concern
shown by the lord-mayor, when the companion
of his childhood is brought before him as a
criminal, is a touching picture, and big with humane
admonition and reflection." The late comedian
Mr. <i>James Love</i> (otherwise <i>Dance</i>, and brother
to the painter of that name) dramatized this series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
of prints; and Mr. <i>King</i>, now deputy-manager
of <i>Drury-lane</i>, performed the character of the Good
'Prentice.</p>

<p>These Plates were retouched by <i>Hogarth</i>; but, as
usual, whatever they gained in respect to force, they
lost in the article of clearness. They offer no variations,
except such as are occasioned by his having
thrown a few of the figures into shade, that others
might appear more prominent. Dr. <i>Ducarel</i> informed
me, that the passages of Scripture applicable to the
different scenes were selected for Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, by
his friend the Rev. Mr. <i>Arnold King</i>.</p>

<p>In the following year was published, price one
shilling (being an explanation of the moral of twelve
celebrated prints lately published, and designed by
the ingenious Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>), "The Effects of Industry
and Idleness, illustrated in the Life, Adventures,
and various Fortunes of Two Fellow
'Prentices of the City of <i>London</i>: shewing the
different Paths, as well as Rewards of Virtue and
Vice; how the good and virtuous 'Prentice, by
gradual Steps of Industry, rose to the highest
Pitch of Grandeur; and how, by contrary Pursuits,
his Fellow-'Prentice, by Laziness and Wickedness,
came to die an ignominious Death at the
Gallows. ¶ This little book ought to be read by
every 'Prentice in <i>England</i>, to imprint in their
hearts these two different examples, the contrary
effects each will produce on their young minds
being of more worth than a hundred times the
price, <i>i. e.</i> an abhorrence of the vice and wickedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
they perceive in the one boy, and, on the
contrary, an endeavour after an imitation of the
actions of the other. And is a more proper present
to be given to the Chamber of <i>London</i>, at the
binding and enrolling an apprentice, than any
other book whatever. Printed by <i>Charles Corbett</i>,
at <i>Addison's</i> Head in <i>Fleet street</i>."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_236" id="Footnote_1_236"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_236"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The following description of <i>Hogarth's</i> design is copied
from his own hand-writing: "Industry and Idleness exemplified
in the conduct of two Fellow 'Prentices: where the one,
by taking good courses, and pursuing points for which he
was put apprentice, becomes a valuable man and an ornament
to his country; the other, by giving way to idleness,
naturally falls into poverty, and ends fatally, as is expressed
in the last print. As the prints were intended more for
use than ornament, they were done in a way that might
bring them within the purchase of whom they might most
concern; and, lest any print should be mistaken, the description
of each print is engraved at top."</p><br /></div>

for a few months with some success. The wooden-cut
was only prefixed to six or seven of the papers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>

they had both been intimately acquainted.</p>

and <i>W. Hogarth. "His own head sketching the view.
He was arrested when he was making the drawing,
but set at liberty when his purpose was known."</i> See
above, p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>. Mr. <i>Walpole</i> also observes, that in
this piece, though it has great merit, "the caricatura
is carried to excess." Mr. <i>Pine</i> the engraver
sat for the portrait of the Friar, a circumstance of
which he afterwards repented;<a name="FNanchor_3_240" id="FNanchor_3_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_240" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> for, thereby obtaining
the nick-name of <i>Friar Pine</i>, and being
much persecuted and laughed at, he strove to prevail
on <i>Hogarth</i> to give his Ghostly father another
face. Indeed, when he sat to our artist, he did not
know to what purpose his similitude would afterwards
be applied. The original picture is in the possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
of the Earl of <i>Charlemont</i>. Soon after it was finished,
it fell down by accident, and a nail ran through the
cross on the top of the gate. <i>Hogarth</i> strove in vain
to mend it with the same colour, so as to conceal the
blemish. He therefore introduced a starved crow,
looking down on the roast-beef, and thus completely
covered the defect.</p>

<p>The figure of the half-starved <i>French</i> centinel has
since been copied at the top of more than one of
the printed advertisements for recruits, where it is
opposed to the representation of a well-fed <i>British</i>
soldier. Thus the genius of <i>Hogarth</i> still militates
in the cause of his country.</p>

<p>A copy of this print was likewise engraved at the
top of a Cantata, intituled, <i>The Roast Beef of Old
England</i>. As it is probable that the latter was published
under the sanction of our artist, I shall, without
scruple, transcribe it.</p>

having been published whilst the present page was preparing
for the second edition, I took the earliest opportunity of letting
that admirable writer speak for himself, in answer to a
particular in which I had presumed to differ from him.
"If <i>Hogarth</i> indulged his spirit of ridicule in personalities," (I
now use the words of Mr. <i>Walpole</i>) "it never proceeded beyond
sketches and drawings; his prints touched the folly,
but spared the person. Early he drew a noted miser, one
of the sheriffs, trying a mastiff that had robbed his kitchen,
but the magistrate's son went to his house and cut the
picture in pieces.<a name="FNanchor_A_241" id="FNanchor_A_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_241" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> I have been reproved for this assertion,"
continues our agreeable Biographer, "and instances have
been pointed out that contradict me. I am far from
persevering in an error, and do allow that my position was
too positive. Still some of the instances adduced were by
no means caricaturas. Sir <i>John Gonson</i> and Dr. <i>Misaubin</i>
in the <i>Harlot's Progress</i> were rather examples identified than
satires. Others, as Mr. <i>Pine's</i>, were mere portraits, introduced
by their own desire, or with their consent."</p>

in its room. See under the year <a href="#Page_387">1763</a>.</p>

<p>On this print, in its original state, the <i>Scandalizade</i>,
a satire published about 1749, has the following
lines. The author represents himself as standing before

To your idle remarks I take leave to demur,<br />
'Tis not <i>Tobit</i>, nor yet his canonical cur,<br />
(Quoth a sage in the crowd) for I'd have you to know, Sir,<br />
'Tis <i>Hogarth</i> himself and his honest friend <i>Towser</i>,<br />
Inseparate companions! and therefore you see<br />
Cheek by jowl they are drawn in familiar degree;<br />
Both striking the eye with an equal eclat,<br />
The biped <i>This</i> here, and the quadruped <i>That</i>&mdash;<br />
You mean&mdash;the great dog and the man, I suppose,<br />
Or the man and the dog&mdash;be't just as you chuse.&mdash;<br />
You correct yourself rightly&mdash;when much to be blam'd,<br />
For the worthiest person you first should have nam'd,<br />
Great dog! why great man I methinks you should say.<br />
Split the difference, my friend, they're both great in their way.<br />
Is't he then so famous for drawing a punk,<br />

Thus a jacknapes a lion would fain recommend.&mdash;<br />
The very self same&mdash;how boldly they strike,<br />
And I can't forbear thinking they're somewhat alike.&mdash;<br />
Oh fie! to a dog would you <i>Hogarth</i> compare?&mdash;<br />
Not so&mdash;I say only they're alike as it were,<br />
A respectable pair! all spectators allow,<br />
And that they deserve a description below<br />
In capital letters, <i>Behold we are Two</i>."<br />

<p>4. Portrait of <i>Hogarth</i>, small circle. Mr. <i>Basire</i>
(to whom this plate has been ascribed) says it is
much in our artist's manner. On enquiry, however,
it appears to be no other than a watch-paper "Published
according to Act of Parliament by <i>R. Sayer</i>,
opposite <i>Fetter-lane, Sept.</i> 29, 1749," and certainly
copied from the small portrait of our artist
introduced in <i>The Roast Beef of Old England</i>. Another
head of him, with a fur cap on, was also edited
by the same printseller, at the same time. There is
likewise a third head of <i>Hogarth</i>, in an oval, prefixed
as a frontispiece to "A Dissertation" on his six prints,
&amp;c. <i>Gin Lane</i>, &amp;c. which appeared in 1751.</p>

<p>1. <i>Thomas Herring</i>, Archbishop of <i>Canterbury.
W. Hogarth p. B. Baron sculp.</i> Of this picture (which
is preserved in <i>Lambeth-Palace</i>) the Archbishop, in
a letter to Mr. <i>Duncombe</i>, says, "None of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
friends can bear <i>Hogarth's</i> picture;" and Mr.
<i>Duncombe</i>, the son, in a note to this epistle, observes,
that "this picture (as appears by the print engraved
by <i>Baron</i> in 1750) exhibits rather a caricature than
a likeness, the figure being gigantic, the features
all aggravated and <i>outrés</i>, and, on the whole, so
far from conveying an idea of that <i>os placidum,
moresque benigni</i>, as Dr. <i>Jortin</i> expresses it, that
engaging sweetness and benevolence, which were
characteristic of this prelate, that they seem rather
expressive of a <i>Bonner</i>, who could burn a heretic.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<i>Lovat's</i> hard features <i>Hogarth</i> might command;<br />
A <i>Herring's</i> sweetness asks a <i>Reynolds'</i> hand."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hogarth</i> however made the following observation
while the Archbishop was sitting to him: "Your
Grace, perhaps, does not know that some of our
chief dignitaries in the church have had the best
luck in their portraits. The most excellent heads
painted by <i>Vandyck</i> and <i>Kneller</i>, were those of
<i>Laud</i> and <i>Tillotson</i>. The crown of my works will
be the representation of your Grace."<br />

head of <i>Gibbs</i>, in a circle, &amp;c. but whether engraved
by <i>Baron</i> from a picture by <i>Hogarth</i>, or any other

resentment for the late king's sending for the picture
to St. James's, and returning it without any other</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
<i>notice.</i>" This print is <i>engraved by Luke Sullivan</i>
but afterwards, as we learn from a note at the bottom
of it, was "Retouched and <i>improved</i> by <i>Wm.
Hogarth</i>, and republished <i>June</i> 12, 1761." The
<i>improvements</i> in it, however, remain to be discovered
by better eyes than mine.</p>

<p>I am authorized to add, that soon after the
lottery described in a note at the beginning of
this article, our artist waited on the treasurer to
the <i>Foundling Hospital</i>, acquainting him that the
trustees were at liberty to dispose of the picture
by auction. Scarce, however, was the message delivered,
before he changed his mind, and never afterwards
would consent to the measure he had originally
proposed. The late Duke of <i>Ancaster</i> offered the
hospital 300 <i>l.</i> for it. The following complete explanation
of it is in <i>The Student</i>, vol. II. p. 16.
It is supposed to have been written by the ingenious
Mr. <i>Bonnel Thornton</i>.</p>

<p>"The scene of this representation is laid at <i>Tottenham
Court Turnpike</i>; the <i>King's-Head, Adam</i> and
<i>Eve</i>, and the <i>Turnpike-house</i>, in full view; beyond
which are discovered parties of the guards, baggage,
&amp;c. marching towards <i>Highgate</i>, and a beautiful
distant prospect of the country; the sky finely
painted. The picture, considered together, affords
a view of a military march, and the humours
and disorders consequent thereupon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Near the center of the picture, the painter has
exhibited his principal figure, which is a handsome
young grenadier, in whose face is strongly depicted
repentance mixed with pity and concern; the occasion
of which is disclosed by two females putting
in their claim for his person, one of whom has
hold of his right arm, and the other has <i>seized</i> his
left. The figure upon his right hand, and perhaps
placed there by the painter by way of preference
(as the object of love is more desirable than
that of duty), is a fine young girl in her person,
debauched, with child, and reduced to the miserable
employ of selling ballads, and who, with a
look full of love, tenderness, and distress, casts up
her eyes upon her undoer, and with tears descending
down her cheeks, seems to say&mdash;&mdash;<i>sure you cannot&mdash;&mdash;will
not leave me</i>! The person and deportment
of this figure well justifies the painter's turning
the body of the youth towards her. The woman
upon the left is a strong contrast to this girl;
for rage and jealousy have thrown the human
countenance into no amiable or desirable form.
This is the wife of the youth, who, finding him
engaged with such an <i>ugly slut</i>, assaults him with a
violence natural to a woman whose person and
beauty is neglected. To the fury of her countenance,
and the dreadful weapon her tongue, another
terror appears in her hand, equally formidable,
which is a roll of papers, whereon is wrote,
<i>The Remembrancer</i>; a word of dire and triple import;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
for while it shews the occupation the <i>amiable
bearer</i> is engaged in, it reminds the youth of
an unfortunate circumstance he would gladly forget:
and the same word is also a cant expression,
to signify the blow she is meditating. And
here, I value myself upon hitting the true meaning,
and entering into the spirit of the great author
of that celebrated <i>Journal</i> called <i>The Remembrancer</i>,
or, <i>A weekly slap on the face for the Ministry</i>.</p>

<p>"It is easily discernible that the two females are
of different parties. The ballad of <i>God save our
noble King</i>, and a print of the <i>Duke of Cumberland</i>,
in the basket of the girl, and the cross upon the
back of the wife, with the implements of her occupation,
sufficiently denote the painter's intention:
and, what is truly beautiful, these incidents are
applicable to the march.</p>

<p>"The hard-favoured serjeant directly behind, who
enjoys the foregoing scene, is not only a good
contrast to the youth, but also, with other helps,
throws forward the principal figure.</p>

<p>"Upon the right of the grenadier is a drummer,
who also has his <i>two Remembrancers</i>, a woman and a
boy, the produce of their kinder hours; and who
have laid their claim by a violent seizure upon
his person. The figure of the woman is that of a
complainant, who reminds him of her great applications,
as well in sending him clean to guard,
as other kind offices done, and his promises to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
make her an honest woman, which he, base and
ungrateful, has forgot, and pays her affection with
neglect. The craning of her neck shews her remonstrances
to be of the shrill kind, in which she
is aided by the howling of her boy. The drummer,
who has a mixture of fun and wickedness in
his face, having heard as many reproaches as suit
his present inclinations, with a bite of his lip, and
a leering eye, applies to the instrument of noise in
his profession, and endeavours to drown the united
clamour; in which he is luckily aided by the <i>ear-piercing
fife</i> near him.</p>

<p>"Between the figures before described, but more
back in the picture, appears the important but
meagre phiz of a <i>Frenchman</i>, in close whisper with
an <i>Independent</i>. The first I suppose a spy upon the
motion of the army, the other probably drawn
into the croud, in order to give intelligence to his
brethren, at their next meeting, to commemorate
their noble struggle in support of <i>Independency</i>.
The <i>Frenchman</i> exhibits a letter, which he assures
him contains positive intelligence, that 10000 of
his countrymen are landed in <i>England</i>, in support
of <i>liberty</i> and <i>independency</i>. The joy with which
his friend receives these glorious tidings, causes
him to forget the wounds upon his head, which he
has unluckily received by a too free and premature
declaration of his principles.</p>

<p>"There is a fine contrast in the smile of innocency
in the child at the woman's back, compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the grim joy of a gentleman by it; while the hard
countenance of its mother gives a delicacy to the
grenadier's girl.</p>

<p>"Directly behind the drummer's quondam spouse,
appears a soldier pissing against a shed; and some
distortions in his countenance indicate a malady
too indelicate to describe; this conjecture is aided
by a bill of Dr. <i>Rock's</i> for relief in like cases. Directly
over him appears a wench at a wicket, probably
drawn there to have a view of the march;
but is diverted from her first intention by the appearance
of another object directly under her eye,
which seems to ingross her whole attention.</p>

<p>"Behind the drummer under the sign of the <i>Adam</i>
and <i>Eve</i> are a group of figures; two of which are
engaged in the fashionable art of bruising: their
equal dexterity is shewn, by <i>sewed-up peepers</i> on
one side, and <i>a pate well-sconced</i> on the other. And
here the painter has shewn his impartiality to the
merit of our <i>noble youths</i>, (whose minds, inflamed
with love of glory, appear, not only encouragers
of this truly laudable science, but many of them
are also great proficients in the art itself,) by
introducing a youth of quality, whose face is expressive
of those boisterous passions necessary for
forming a hero of this kind; and who, entering
deep into the scene, endeavours to inspire the
combatants with a noble contempt of bruises and
broken bones. An old woman, moved by a foolish
compassion, endeavours to force through the croud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
and part the fray, in which design she is stopped
by a fellow, who prefers fun and mischief to humanity.
Above their heads appears a little man<a name="FNanchor_3_245" id="FNanchor_3_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_245" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
of meagre frame, but full of spirits, who enjoys
the combat, and with fists clenched, in imagination
deals blow for blow with the heroes. This
figure is finely contrasted, by a heavy sluggish fellow
just behind. The painter, with a stroke of
humour peculiar to himself, has exhibited a figure
shrinking under the load of a heavy box upon his
back, who, preferring curiosity to ease, is a spectator,
and waits in this uneasy state the issue of the
combat. Upon a board next the sign, where roots,
flowers, &amp;c. were said to be sold, the painter has
humorously altered the words, and wrote thereon,
<i>Tottenham-Court Nursery</i>; alluding to a bruising-booth
in this place, and the group of figures underneath.</p>

<p>"Passing through the turnpike, appears a carriage
laden with the implements of war, as drums, halberts,
tent-poles, and hoop-petticoats. Upon the
carriage are two old women-campaigners, funking
their pipes, and holding a conversation, as usual,
in fire and smoke. These grotesque figures afford
a fine contrast to a delicate woman upon the same
carriage, who is suckling a child. This excellent
figure evidently proves, that the painter is as capable
of succeeding in the graceful style as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
humorous. A little boy laes at the feet of this
figure; and the painter, to shew him of martial
breed, has placed a small trumpet in his mouth.</p>

<p>"The serious group of the principal figures, in
the center, is finely relieved by a scene of humour
on the left. Here an officer has seized a milk-wench,
and is kissing her in a manner excessively
lewd, yet not unpleasing to the girl, if her eye is
a proper interpreter of her affections: while the
officer's ruffles suffer in this action, the girl pays
her price, by an arch soldier, who in her absence
of attention to her pails, is filling his hat with
milk, and, by his waggish eye, seems also to partake
of the kissing scene. A chimney-sweeper's
boy with glee puts in a request to the soldier, to
supply him with a cap full, when his own turn is
served; while another soldier points out the fun to
a fellow selling pyes, who, with an inimitable face
of simple joy, neglects the care of his goods, which
the soldier dexterously removes with his other
hand. In the figure of the pye-man, the pencil has
exceeded description&mdash;&mdash;here the sounding epithets
of <i>prodigious&mdash;excellent&mdash;wonderful</i>&mdash;and all
the other terms used by Connoisseurs (when speaking
of the beauties of an old picture, where the
objects must have lain in eternal obscurity, if not
conjured out to the apprehension of the spectator,
by the magic of unintelligible description)
are too faint to point out its real merit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>"The old soldier divested of one spatter-dash, and
near losing the other, and knocked down by all-potent
gin, upon calling for t'other cogue, his
waggish comrade, supporting him with one hand,
endeavours to pour water into his mouth with the
other, which the experienced old one rejects with
disdain, puts up his hand to his wife who bears
the arms and gin-bottle, and who, well acquainted
with his taste, is filling a quartern. And here
the painter exhibits a sermon upon the excessive
use of spirituous liquors, and the destructive consequences
attending it: for the soldier is not only
rendered incapable of his duty, but (what is
shocking to behold) a child begot and conceived
in gin, with a countenance emaciated, extends its
little arms with great earnestness, and wishes for
that liquor, which it seems well acquainted with
the taste of. And here, not to dwell wholly upon
the beauties of this print, I must mention an absurdity
discovered by a professed connoisseur in
painting&mdash;'Can there,' says he, 'be a greater absurdity
than the introducing a couple of chickens
so near such a croud&mdash;and not only so&mdash;but see&mdash;their
direction is to go to objects it is natural for
'em to shun&mdash;is this is knowledge of nature?&mdash;absurd
to the last degree!'&mdash;&mdash;And here, with an
air of triumph, ended our judicious critic. But
how great was his surprize, when it was discovered
to him, that the said chickens were in pursuit of
the hen, which had made her escape into the pocket
of a sailor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Next the sign-post is an honest tar throwing up
his hat, crying 'God bless King <i>George</i>.' Before
him is an image of drunken loyalty; who, with
his shirt out of his breeches, and bayonet in his
hand, vows destruction on the heads of the rebels.
A fine figure of a speaking old woman, with a
basket upon her head, will upon view tell you what
she sells. A humane soldier perceiving a fellow
hard-loaded with a barrel of gin upon his back,
and stopped by the croud, with a gimblet bores
a hole in the head of the cask, and is kindly easing
him of a part of his burthen. Near him, is the
figure of a fine gentleman in the army. As I suppose
the painter designed him without character,
I shall therefore only observe, that he is a very
pretty fellow, and happily the contemplation of
his own dear person guards him from the attempts
of the wicked women on his right hand. Upon
the right hand of this <i>petit maitre</i> is a licentious
soldier rude with a girl, who screams and wreaks
her little vengeance upon his face, whilst his comrade
is removing off some linen which hangs in
his way.</p>

<p>"You will pardon the invention of a new term&mdash;I
shall include the whole <i>King's Head</i> in the word
<i>Cattery</i>, the principal figure of which is a noted
fat <i>Covent Garden</i> lady,<a name="FNanchor_4_246" id="FNanchor_4_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_246" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who, with pious eyes cast
up to heaven, prays for the army's success, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the safe return of many of her babes of grace. An
officer offers a letter to one of this lady's children,
who rejects it; possibly not liking the cause her
spark is engaged in, or, what is more probable,
his not having paid for her last favour. Above
her, a charitable girl is throwing a shilling to a
cripple, while another kindly administers a cordial
to her companion, as a sure relief against reflection.
The rest of the windows are full of the
like cattle; and upon the house-top appear three
cats, just emblems of the creatures below, but
more harmless in their amorous encounters."</p>

<p>There is likewise another explanation in <i>The Old
Woman's Magazine</i>, vol. I. p. 182. To elucidate a
circumstance, however, in this justly celebrated performance,
it is necessary to observe, that near <i>Tottenham
Court Nursery</i> was the place where the famous
<i>Broughton's</i> amphitheatre for boxing was erected.
It has been since taken down, having been rendered
useless by the justices not permitting such kind of
diversions. This will account for the appearance of
the Bruisers at the left hand corner of the print.
One of <i>Hogarth's</i> ideas in this performance also needs
the assistance of colouring, to render it intelligible.
The person to whom the <i>Frenchman</i> is delivering a
letter, was meant for an old <i>Highlander</i> in disguise,
as appears from the plaid seen through an opening
in his grey coat; a circumstance in the print that
escaped me, till after I had seen the picture, and
perused <i>Rouquet's</i> explanation of this particular circumstance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
which I shall add in his own words, with
his reflections at the end of it. "A droite du principal
group paroit une figure de <i>François</i>, qu'on
a voulu representer comme un homme de quelque
importance, afin de lui donner plus de ridicule;
il parle à un homme dont la nation est indiquée
par l'etoffe de sa veste, qui est celle dont s'habillent
les habitans des montagnes <i>d'Ecosse</i>: le <i>François</i>
semble communiquer à l'<i>Ecossois</i> des lettres qu'il
vient de reçevoir, &amp; qui ont rapport à l'evenement
qui donne lieu à cette marche. Les <i>Anglois</i>
ne se réjouissent jamais bien sans qu'il en coute
quelque chose aux <i>François</i>; leur theatre, leur
conversation, leurs tableaux, et sur tout ceux de
notre peintre, portent toujours cette glorieuse
marque de l'amour de la patrie; les romans même
sont ornés de traits amusans sur cet ancien sujet;
l'excellent auteur de <i>Tom Jones</i> a voulu aussi lâcher
les siens. Mais le pretendu mépris pour les
<i>François</i> dont le peuple de ce pais-ci fait profession,
s'explique selon moi d'une façon fort équivoque.
Le mépris suppose l'oubli; mais un objet dont
on médit perpetuèllement est un objet dont on est
perpetuèllement occupé: la satire constitue une
attention qui me feroit soupconner qu'on fait aux
<i>François</i> l'honneur de les haïr un peu."</p>

<p>All the off tracts from the faces in the original
picture of the March to <i>Finchley</i>, in red chalk on
oiled paper, are still preserved.</p>

<p>This representation may be said to contain three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
portraits, all of which were acknowledged by the
artist: a noted <i>French</i> pye-man; one of the young
fifers then recently introduced into the army by the
Duke of <i>Cumberland</i>; and a chimney-sweeper with
an aspect peculiarly roguish. The two latter were
hired by <i>Hogarth</i>, who gave each of them half a
crown, for his patience in sitting while his likeness was
taken. Among the portraits in the <i>March to Finchley</i>
(says a correspondent) that of <i>Jacob Henriques</i>
may also be discovered. I wish it had been pointed
out.</p>

<p>With this plate (of which the very few proofs in
aqua-fortis, as well as the finished ones, are highly
valuable) no unfair stratagems have been practised,
that a number of the various impressions, taken off
at different times, might be mistaken for the earliest.
On copper nothing is more easy than to cover, alter,
efface, or re-engrave an inscription, as often as
temporary convenience may require a change in it.<a name="FNanchor_5_247" id="FNanchor_5_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_247" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Witness, the several copies of <i>The Lottery</i>, three of
which exhibit the names of three different publishers:
the fourth has none at all.</p>

<p>The possessors of this March to <i>Finchley</i> need not
vehemently lament their want of the original. The
spirit of it is most faithfully transfused on the copper.
As to the colouring, it will hardly delight such eyes
are are accustomed to the pictures of <i>Steen</i> or <i>Teniers</i>.
To me the painting of the <i>March to Finchley</i> appears
hard and heavy, and has much the air of a coloured
print.</p>

<p>I should not, on this occasion, omit to add,
that Mr. <i>Strange</i>, in his <i>Inquiry into the Rise and
Establishment of the Royal Academy of Arts in London</i>,
observes, that "the donations in painting which several
artists presented to <i>The Foundling Hospital</i>,"
first led to the idea of those Exhibitions which are at
present so lucrative to our Royal Academy, and so
entertaining to the publick. <i>Hogarth</i> must certainly
be considered as a chief among these benefactors.</p>

that only twenty-five were worked off with this literal imperfection,
as <i>Hogarth</i> grew tired of adding the mark ~ with a
pen over one S, to supply the want of the other. He therefore
ordered the inscription to be corrected before any greater
number of impressions were taken. Though this circumstance
was mentioned by Mr. <i>Thane</i>, to whose experience in such
matters some attention is due, it is difficult to suppose that
<i>Hogarth</i> was fatigued with correcting his own mistake in so
small a number of the first Impressions. I may venture to
add, that I have seen, at least, five and twenty marked in the
manner already described: and it is scarce possible, considering
the multitudes of these plates dispersed in the world, that

printsellers to take off a number of them, amounting, perhaps,
to hundreds, from every plate of considerable value;
and yet their want of rareness has by no means abated their
price. On retouching a plate, it has been also usual, among
the same conscientious fraternity, to cover the inscription,
which was immediately added after the first proofs were obtained,
with slips of paper, that a number of secondary proofs
might also be created. This device is notorious, and too often
practised, without discovery, on the unskilful purchaser. A
new print, in short, is of the same use to a crafty dealer, as
a fresh girl to a politic bawd. In both instances <i>le fausse pucelage</i>
is disposed of many times over.</p></div>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes, that the variation of the butcher
lifting the <i>Frenchman</i> in his hand, was an after-thought;<a name="FNanchor_2_249" id="FNanchor_2_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_249" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
but he is mistaken. This <i>butcher</i> is in
reality a <i>blacksmith</i>; and the violent hyperbole is
found in the original drawing, as well as in the earliest
impressions of the plate. The first copies of
<i>Beer-street, Gin Lane,</i> and <i>The Stages of Cruelty,</i> were
taken off on very thin paper; but this being objected
to, they were afterwards printed on thicker. The
painter, who in the former of these scenes is copying
a bottle from one hanging by him as a pattern, has
been regarded as a stroke of satire on <i>John Stephen
Liotard</i>, who (as Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes) "could
render nothing but what he saw before his eyes."<a name="FNanchor_3_250" id="FNanchor_3_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_250" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that <i>Hogarth</i> received the first idea
for these two prints from a pair of others by <i>Peter</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
<i>Breugel</i> (commonly called <i>Breugel d'enfer</i>, or <i>Hellish
Breugel</i>), which exhibit a contrast of a similar kind.
The one is entitled <i>La grasse</i>, the other <i>La maigre
Cuisine</i>. In the first, all the personages are well-fed
and plump; in the second, they are starved and
slender. The latter of them also exhibits the figures
of an emaciated mother and child, sitting on a straw-mat
upon the ground, whom I never saw without
thinking on the female, &amp;c. in <i>Gin Lane</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_251" id="FNanchor_4_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_251" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In <i>Hogarth</i>,
the fat <i>English</i> blacksmith is insulting the
gaunt <i>Frenchman</i>; and in <i>Breugel</i>, the plump cook
is kicking the lean one out of doors. Our artist
was not unacquainted with the works of this master,
as will appear by an observation on the <a href="#Page_331"><i>Lilliputians</i>

and <i>The Four Stages of Cruelty</i>, Containing, I. A
genuine narrative of the horrible deeds perpetrated
by that fiery dragon, <i>Gin</i>; the wretched and deplorable
condition of its votaries and admirers;
the dreadful havock and devaluation it has made

who wished to diffuse the salutary example they
contain, as far as possible, by putting them within
the reach of the meanest purchaser; but finding this
mode of executing his design was expensive beyond

are to be had at Mrs. <i>Hogarth's</i> house in <i>Leicester-fields</i>.

<p><a name="Footnote_3_254" id="Footnote_3_254"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_254"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In the last of these plates, "how delicate and superior,"
as Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes, "is <i>Hogarth's</i> satire, when he intimates,
in the College of Physicians and Surgeons that preside
at a dissection, how the legal habitude of viewing shocking
scenes hardens the human mind, and renders it unfeeling.
The president maintains the dignity of insensibility over an
executed corpse, and considers it but as the object of a
lecture. In the print of the Sleeping Judges, this habitual
indifference only excites our laughter." To render
his spectacle, however, more shocking, our artist has perhaps
deviated from nature, against whose laws he so rarely
offends. He has impressed marks of agony on the face of
the criminal under dissection; whereas it is well known, that,
the most violent death once past, the tumult of the features
subsides for ever. But, in <i>Hogarth's</i> print, the wretch who
has been executed, seems to feel the subsequent operation.
Of this plate Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i> has the original drawing.</p><br /></div>


<p>3. Boys peeping at Nature, with Variations.</p>

<p>Receipt for <i>Moses brought to Pharaoh's Daughter</i>,
and St. <i>Paul before Felix</i>.</p>

<p>The burlesque <i>Paul</i>, &amp;c. being the current receipt
for these two prints, I know not why our artist
should have altered and vamped up his <i>Boys peeping
at Nature</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_188">188</a>.) for the same purpose. This
plate was lately found at Mrs. <i>Hogarth's</i>, but no former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
impressions from it appear to have been circulated.
It might have been a first thought, before
the idea of its ludicrous successor occurred. <i>Hogarth</i>,
however, with propriety, effaced all the wit in his
original design, before he meant to offer it as a prologue
to his uninteresting serious productions.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>4. <i>Paul</i> before <i>Felix</i>, designed and scratched in
the true <i>Dutch</i> taste, by <i>W. Hogarth</i>. This was the
receipt for <i>Pharaoh's</i> daughter, and for the serious
<i>Paul</i> and <i>Felix</i>; and is a satire on <i>Dutch</i> pictures.
It also contains, in the character of a serjeant tearing
his brief, a portrait of <i>Hume Campbell</i>, who was not
over-delicate in the language he used at the bar to
his adversaries and antagonists. This, however, is
said by others to be the portrait of <i>William King</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_255" id="FNanchor_1_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_255" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
LL. D. Principal of <i>St. Mary Hall, Oxford</i>. In a variation
of this print, the Devil is introduced sawing
off a leg of the stool on which <i>Paul</i> stands. In the
<i>third</i> impression, as is noted in the collection sold last
at <i>Christie's</i>, "<i>Hogarth</i> has again taken out the Devil.
By these variations of <i>Devil and no Devil</i>, he glances
at Collectors, who give great prices for such rarities;
and perhaps he had in his eye the famous
print of the Shepherd's Offering by <i>Poilly</i>, after
<i>Guido</i>, which sells very dear, without the Angels."
This, however, is erroneous. After the dæmon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
once admitted, he was never discarded. The plate
in Mrs. <i>Hogarth's</i> keeping confirms my assertion.
In the first proof of <i>Poilly's Shepherd's Offering</i>, the
angels are lightly sketched in; in the finished proof
they are totally omitted; but were afterwards inserted.
There are similar variations relative to the arms
at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>Of this burlesque <i>Paul</i>, &amp;c. none were originally
intended for sale; but our artist gave them away to
such of his acquaintance, &amp;c. as begged for them.
The number of these petitioners, however, increasing
every day, he resolved at last to part with no copies
of it at a less price than five shillings.<a name="FNanchor_2_256" id="FNanchor_2_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_256" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> All the early
proofs were stained by himself, to give them that tint
of age which is generally found on the works of
<i>Rembrandt</i>. Of this plate, however, there are <i>two</i>
impressions. The inscription under the <i>first</i> is
"<i>Paul</i> before <i>Felix</i>. Design'd and scratch'd in the
true <i>Dutch</i> taste by &amp;c." Under the <i>second</i>,
"Designed and etch'd in the ridiculous manner of
<i>Rembrant</i>, &amp;c." From the former of these <i>Hogarth</i>
took off a few reverses. He must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
been severely mortified when he found his ludicrous
representation of <i>Paul</i> before <i>Felix</i> was more coveted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and admired than his serious painting on the same
subject.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_256" id="Footnote_2_256"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_256"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Mr. <i>Walpole</i> has honoured a passage in the first edition of
this hasty work, with the following stricture: (see Anecdotes
of Painting, vol. IV. p. 149).
</p>
<p>
"I have been blamed for censuring the indelicacies of <i>Flemish</i>
and <i>Dutch</i> painters, by comparing them with the <i>purity</i>
of <i>Hogarth</i>, against whom are produced many instances
of indelicacy, and some repetitions of the same indelicacy.
I will not defend myself by pleading that these instances are
thinly scattered through a great number of his works, and
that there is at least humour in most of the incidents quoted,
and that they insinuate some reflection, which is never the
case of the foreigners&mdash;but can I chuse but smile when one
of the nastiest examples specified is from the burlesque of
<i>Paul</i> before <i>Felix</i>, professedly in ridicule of the gross images
of the <i>Dutch</i>?"
</p>
<p>
In consequence of private remarks from Mr. <i>W.</i> this questionable
position, as well as a few others, had been obviated in
my second impression of the trifling performance now offered
to the public: but as our author cannot <i>chuse but smile</i>,
when the occasion of his mirth was no longer meant to be
in his way, I would ask, in defence of my former observation,
if moralists usually attempt to reform profligates by writing
treatises of profligacy? or, if painters have a right to chastise
indelicacy, by exhibiting gross examples of it in their own
performances? To become indecent ourselves, is an unwarrantable
recipe for curing indecency in others. The obscenities
of <i>Juvenal</i> have hitherto met with no very successful vindication:
"Few are the converts <i>Aretine</i> has made." According
to our critic's mode of reasoning, a homicide might urge
that the crime of which he stands accused was committed
only as a salutary example of the guilt of murder; nay, thus
indeed every human offence might be allowed to bring with
it its own apology.&mdash;I forbear to proceed in this argument,
or might observe in behalf of our "foreigners," that their
incidents insinuate some reflections as well as <i>Hogarth's</i>. The
evacuations introduced in <i>Dutch</i> pictures, most certainly inculcate
the necessity of temperance, for those only who eat
and drink too much at fairs, or in ale-houses, are liable to
such public and unseemly accidents as <i>Heemskirk, Ostade,</i> and
<i>Teniers,</i> have occasionally represented. If we are to look for
"Sermons in stones, and good in everything," this inference
is as fair as many which Mr. <i>W.</i> seems inclined to produce
in honour of poor <i>Hogarth</i>, who, like <i>Shakspeare</i>, often sought
to entertain, without keeping any moral purpose in view.
But was there either wit or morality in <i>Hogarth's</i> own evacuation
against the door of a church, a circumstance recorded
by Mr. <i>Forrest</i> in his MS. tour, though prudently suppressed
in his printed copy of it? Perhaps, following Uncle <i>Toby's</i>
advice, he had better have wiped the whole up, and said nothing
about the matter. Our worthy Tour-writer, however,
was by no means qualified to be the author of a Sentimental
Journey. He rather (and purposely, as we are told) resembles
<i>Ben Jonson's</i> communicative traveller, who says to his
companion,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
&mdash;&mdash;I went and paid a moccinigo<br />
For mending my silk stockings; by the way<br />
I cheapen'd sprats, and at <i>St. Mark's</i> I urin'd.<br />
Faith, these are politic notes!<br />

<p><a name="Footnote_1_257" id="Footnote_1_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_257"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It should here be remarked, that the heads of several
of the figures in the original, differ widely from those in the
engraving. The daughter of the <i>Egyptian</i> Monarch appears
to more advantage in the print than on the canvas, for there
she resembles a wanton under-actress, who, half-undrest, and
waiting for her keeper, employs the interval of time in settling
accounts with a washerwoman, who has her bastard at nurse,
and has just brought him home to convince her that young
<i>Curl-pated Hugh</i> has no shoes to his feet. The colouring of
this piece is beneath criticism. I have just been told the head
of <i>Pharaoh's</i> daughter was copied from one <i>Seaton</i>, a smock-faced
youth of our artist's acquaintance: a proper model, no
doubt, for an <i>Eastern</i> Princess! <i>Hogarth</i> could not, like <i>Guido</i>,
draw a <i>Venus</i> from a common porter.</p></div>

<p>1. <i>Columbus</i> breaking the egg. "<i>The subscription-ticket
to his Analysis.</i>" First payment 5 <i>s. Hogarth</i>
published this print as a sarcasm on those artists
who had been inclined to laugh at his boasted
line of beauty, as a discovery which every one might
have made.<br />

<p>2. Analysis of Beauty. Two plates. Mr. <i>Walpole</i>
observes, that <i>Hogarth's</i> "samples of grace in a
young lord and lady are strikingly stiff and affected.
They are a <i>Bath</i> beau and a county beauty."
The print is found in three different states.
"In the original plate the principal figure represented
the present king, then prince, but <i>Hogarth</i> was
desired to alter it. The present figure was taken
from the last duke of <i>Kingston</i>; yet, though like
him, is stiff, and far from graceful."<a name="FNanchor_1_258" id="FNanchor_1_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_258" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In Plate I.
Fig. 19. the fat personage drest in a <i>Roman</i> habit,
and elevated on a pedestal, was designed, as <i>Hogarth</i>
himself acknowledged, for a ridicule on <i>Quin</i> in the
character of <i>Coriolanus. Essex</i> the dancing-master is
also represented in the act of endeavouring to reduce
the graceful attitude of <i>Antinous</i> to modern stiffness.
Fig. 20. was likewise meant for the celebrated <i>Desnoyer</i>,
dancing in a grand ballet.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Beattie</i>, speaking of the modes of combination,
by which incongruous qualities may be presented to
the eye, or the fancy, so as to provoke laughter, observes
"A country dance of men and women, like
those exhibited by <i>Hogarth</i> in his Analysis of Beauty,
could hardly fail to make a beholder merry,
whether he believed their union to be the effect
of design or accident. Most of those persons
have incongruities of their own in their shape,
dress, or attitude, and all of them are incongruous
in respect of one another; thus far the assemblage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
displays contrariety or want of relation: and they
are all united in the same dance; and thus far
they are mutually related. And if we suppose the
two elegant figures removed, which might be
done without lessening the ridicule, we should not
easily discern any contrast of dignity and meanness
in the group that remains.</p>

<p>"Almost the same remarks might be made on
<i>The Enraged Musician</i>, another piece of the same
great master, of which a witty author quaintly says,
that it deafens one to look at it. This extraordinary
group forms a very comical mixture of incongruity
and relation; of incongruity, owing to
the dissimilar employment and appearances of the
several persons, and to the variety and dissonance
of their respective noises; and of relation, owing
to their being all united in the same place, and
for the same purpose of tormenting the poor fidler.
From the various sounds co-operating to this one
end, the piece becomes more laughable, than if
their meeting were conceived to be without any
particular destination; for the greater number of
relations, as well as of contrarieties, that take
place in any ludicrous assembly, the more ludicrous
it will generally appear. Yet, though this
group comprehends not any mixture of meanness
and dignity, it would, I think, be allowed to be
laughable to a certain degree, merely from the
juxta-position of the objects, even though it were
supposed to be accidental." Essay on Laughter
and Ludicrous Composition, 4to Edit. 608.</p>

<p>"I have no new books, alas! to amuse myself or
you; so can only return yours of <i>Hogarth's</i> with
thanks. It surprized me agreeably; for I had
conceived the performance to be a set of prints
only, whereas I found a book which I did not
imagine <i>Hogarth</i> capable of writing; for in his
pencil I always confided, but never imagined his
pen would have afforded me so much pleasure.
As to his not fixing <i>the precise degree of obliquity</i>,
which constitutes beauty, I forgive him, because I
think the task too hard to be performed literally:
but yet he conveys an idea between his pencil and
his pen, which makes one conceive his meaning
pretty well." Lady <i>Luxborough's</i> Letters, p. 380.</p>

<p>I shall here transcribe as much from the <i>Analysis</i> as
is necessary to communicate our artist's design relative
to the various figures that compose the country-dance
in the second plate. The reader who neither
possesses the book, nor wishes to accompany the
author throughout his technical explanations, may
desire some intelligence concerning the present subject.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"CHAP. XIV.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Of Attitude.</span></span></p>


<p>"&mdash;As two or three lines at first are sufficient to shew
the intention of an attitude, I will take this opportunity
of presenting my reader with the sketch of
a country-dance, in the manner I began to set out
the design; in order to shew how few lines are necessary
to express the first thoughts as to different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
attitudes [see fig. 71. T. p. 2.], which describe,
in some measure, the several figures and actions,
mostly of the ridiculous kind, that are represented
in the chief part of plate II.</p>

<p>"The most amiable person may deform his general
appearance by throwing his body and limbs into
plain lines; but such lines appear still in a more
disagreeable light in people of a particular make;
I have therefore chose such figures as I thought
would agree best with my first score of lines, fig. 71.</p>

<p>"The two parts of curves next to 71, served for
the old woman and her partner at the farther end
of the room. The curve and two strait lines at
right angles gave the hint for the fat man's
sprawling posture. I next resolved to keep a figure
within the bounds of a circle, which produced
the upper part of the fat woman between the fat
man and the aukward one in a bag-wig, for whom
I had made a sort of an X. The prim lady, his
partner, in the riding habit, by pecking back her
elbows, as they call it, from the waist upwards,
made a tolerable D, with a straight line under it,
to signify the scanty stiffness of her petticoat; and
a Z stood for the singular position the body makes
with the legs and thighs of the affected fellow
in the tye-wig; the upper part of his plump partner
was confined to an O, and this, changed into a
P, served as a hint for the straight lines behind.<a name="FNanchor_2_259" id="FNanchor_2_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_259" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
The uniform diamond of a card was filled by the
flying dress, &amp;c. of the little capering fellow in
the Spencer wig; whilst a double L marked the
parallel position of his poking partner's hands and
arms [<i>N. B. This figure was copied from that of an
uncouth young female whom</i> Hogarth <i>met with at</i>
Isleworth <i>assembly</i>]: and, lastly, the two waving
lines were drawn for the more genteel turns of the
two figures at the hither end.</p>

<p>"The drawing-room is also ornamented purposely
with such statues and pictures as may serve to a
farther illustration. <i>Henry</i> VIII. [Fig. 72. P. 2]
makes a perfect X with his legs and arms; and
the position of <i>Charles</i> [Fig. 51. P. 2.] is composed
of less-varied lines than the statue of <i>Edward</i>
VI. [Fig. 73. P. 2.]; and the medal over his head
is in the like kind of lines; but that over Q. <i>Elizabeth</i>,
as well as her figure, is in the contrary; so
are also the two other wooden figures at the end.
Likewise the comical posture of astonishment expressed
by following the direction of one plain
curve, as the dotted line in a <i>French</i> print of <i>Sancho</i>,
where Don <i>Quixote</i> demolishes the puppet-show
[Fig. 75. R. P. 2], is a good contrast to the
effect of the serpentine lines in the fine turn of the
<i>Samaritan</i> woman [Fig. 75. L. p. 2.] taken from
one of the best pictures <i>Annibal Carache</i> ever
painted."</p>

<p>Respecting the plate numbered I. there are no variations.
In its companion the changes repeatedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
made as to the two principal figures are more numerous
than I had at first observed. It may, however,
be sufficient for me to point out some single circumstance
in each, that may serve as a mark of distinction.
In the first, the principal female has scarce any string
to her necklace; in the second it is lengthened; and
still more considerably increased in the third. In the
first and second editions also of this plate, between
the young lord and his partner (and just under the
figure of the man who is pointing out the stateliness
of some of K. <i>Henry</i> VIIIth's proportions to a lady),
is a vacant easy chair. In the third impression this
chair is occupied by a person asleep. I have lately
been assured that this country-dance was originally
meant to have formed one of the scenes in the <i>Happy
Marriage</i>. The old gentleman hastening away his
daughter, while the servant is putting on his spatter-dashes,
seems to countenance the supposition; and
having since examined the original sketch in oil,
which is in Mr. <i>Ireland's</i> possession, I observe that
the dancing-room is terminated by a large old-fashioned
bow-window, a circumstance perfectly consistent
with the scenery of the wedding described in
p. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I may add, that in this picture, the couple designed
for specimens of grace, appear, not where they
stand in the print, but at the upper end of the room:
and so little versed was our painter in the etiquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
of a wedding-ball, that he has represented the bride
dancing with the bridegroom.<a name="FNanchor_3_260" id="FNanchor_3_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_260" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>When <i>Hogarth</i> shewed the original painting, from
which this dance has been engraved, to my informant,
he desired him to observe a pile of hats in the
corner, all so characteristic of their respective owners,
that they might with ease be picked out, and given
to the parties for whom they were designed.</p>

<p>This was originally published about 1727, or 1728,
under the title of "The punishment inflicted on <i>Lemuel

<p>More than the general idea of this print is stolen
from another by <i>Hellish Breugel</i>, whom I have already

postern is thrust out, like that of <i>Gulliver</i>, to favour
their operations. <i>Breugel</i> has no less than three prints
on this subject, with considerable variations from
each other.</p>

<p>"When <i>Hogarth's</i> topics were harmless," says
Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, "all his touches were marked with
pleasantry and fun. He never laughed, like <i>Rabelais</i>,
at nonsense that he imposed for wit; but,
like <i>Swift</i>, combined incidents that divert one
from their unexpected encounter, and illustrate
the tale he means to tell. Such are the hens
roosting on the upright waves in the scene of the
Strollers, and the devils drinking porter on the
altar." The print now before us is, however, no
very happy exemplification of our critick's remark.</p>

has been already described. See p. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>. The engraved
forms of a receipt annexed to it do not always

eldest) it contains an acknowledgement for "Five
Shillings, being the first payment for a print representing
an Election Entertainment, which I
promise to deliver, when finished, on the receipt
of five shillings and sixpence more." The second

by <i>Sullivan</i>. Satire on false perspective. Motto,
"Whoever maketh a design without the knowledge
of Perspective, will be liable to such absurdities
as are shewn in this frontispiece." The occasion
of engraving the plate arose from the mistakes of
Sir E. <i>Walpole</i>, who was learning to draw without
being taught perspective. To point out in a strong
light the errors which would be likely to happen
from the want of acquaintance with those principles,
this design was produced. It was afterwards given to
<i>Kirby</i>, who dedicated Dr. <i>Brook Taylor's</i> Method of
Perspective to Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>. The above anecdote is
recorded on the authority of the gentleman already
mentioned. The plate, after the first quantity of
impressions had been taken from it, was retouched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>

draw without having some knowledge in perspective. As
the production of that great genius, it is entertaining;
and, though abounding with the grossest absurdities possible,
may pass and please; otherwise I think it is a palpable insult
offered to common sense, and tacitly calling the artists
a parcel of egregious blockheads. There is not a finished
piece in the book, but the mason's yard and the landscapes;
so that I question if the whole of the plates were forty

<p>1. Four prints of an Election.<a name="FNanchor_1_264" id="FNanchor_1_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_264" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These, by <i>Hogarth</i>,
came out at different times, <i>viz.</i> Plate I.
<i>Feb.</i> 24, 1755 (inscribed to the Right Hon. <i>Henry
Fox</i>); Plate II. <i>Feb.</i> 20, 1757, (to his Excellency
Sir <i>Charles Hanbury Williams</i>, Ambassador to the
Court of <i>Russia</i>); Plate III. <i>Feb.</i> 20, 1758, (to the
Hon. Sir <i>Edward Walpole</i>, Knight of the Bath);
Plate IV. <i>Jan.</i> 1, 1758, (to the Hon. <i>George Hay</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_265" id="FNanchor_2_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_265" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
The original pictures are now in the possession of
Mrs. <i>Garrick</i>, at <i>Hampton</i>. The inscription on the
banner, "Give us our eleven days," alludes to the
alteration of the Style in 1752; in which year, from
the 2d to the 14th of <i>September</i>, eleven days were
not reckoned by act of parliament. In the election-dinner,
Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> assured the writer of this paragraph,
that there is but one at table intended for a
real portrait and that is the <i>Irish</i> gentleman [the
present Sir <i>John Parnell</i>, nephew to the poet, and
remarkable for a very flat nose], who is diverting the
company by a face drawn with a burnt cork upon
the back of his hand, while he is supposed to be
singing&mdash;<i>An old woman cloathed in grey</i>. This gentleman
(then an eminent attorney) begged it as a
favour; declaring, at the same time, he was so generally
known, that the introduction of his face
would be of service to our artist in the sale of his
prints at <i>Dublin</i>. Notwithstanding <i>Hogarth's</i> assertion,
the handsome candidate is pronounced to be
the late <i>Thomas Potter</i>, esq. and the effigy, seen
through the window, with the words "<i>No Jews</i>"
about its neck, to be meant for the late Duke of
<i>Newcastle</i>. Of yet another real personage we receive
notice, from a pamphlet intituled "The last Blow,
or an unanswerable vindication of the Society of
<i>Exeter College</i>, in reply to the Vice-chancellor Dr.
<i>King</i>, and the writers of <i>The London Evening Post</i>."
4to. 1755. p. 21.&mdash;"The next character, to whose
merits we would do justice, is the Rev. Dr. <i>C&mdash;ff&mdash;t</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
<i>(Cofferat)</i>. But as it is very difficult to delineate
this fellow in colours sufficiently strong and lively,
it is fortunate for us and the Doctor, that <i>Hogarth</i>
has undertaken that task. In the print of an
Election Entertainment, the publick will see the
Doctor represented sitting among the freeholders,
and zealously eating and drinking for the sake of
the New Interest. His venerable and humane
aspect will at once bespeak the dignity and benevolence
of his heart. Never did alderman at
<i>Guildhall</i> devour custard with half such an appearance
of love to his country, or swallow ale
with so much the air of a patriot. These circumstances
the pencil of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> will undoubtedly
make manifest; but it is much to be lamented,
that his words also cannot appear in this print, and
that the artist cannot delineate that persuasive flow
of eloquence which could prevail upon Copyholders
to abjure their base tenures, and swear themselves
Freeholders. But this oratory (far different
from the balderdash of <i>Tully</i> and Dr. <i>King</i>, concerning
liberty and our country) as the genius of mild
ale alone could inspire, this fellow alone could deliver."&mdash;The
very paper of tobacco, inscribed
"<i>Kirton's</i> Best," has its peculiar significance. This
man was a tobacconist by St. <i>Dunstan's</i> Church in
<i>Fleet-street</i>, and ruined his health and constitution, as
well as impaired his circumstances, by being busy
in the <i>Oxfordshire</i> election of 1754. Plate II. In the
painted cloth depending from the sign-post, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
height of <i>The Treasury</i> is contrasted with the squat
solidity of <i>The Horse-Guards</i>, where the arch is so
low, that the state-coachman cannot pass through it
with his head on; and the turret on the top is so
drawn as to resemble a beer-barrel. <i>Ware</i> the architect
very gravely remarked, on this occasion, that the
chief defect would have been sufficiently pointed out
by making the coachman only stoop. He was hurt
by <i>Hogarth's</i> stroke of satire. Money is likewise
thrown from <i>The Treasury</i> windows, to be put into
a waggon, and carried into the country. <i>George
Alexander Stevens</i>, in his celebrated "Lecture on
Heads," exhibited the man with a pot of beer,
explaining, with pieces of a tobacco-pipe, how
<i>Porto Bello</i> was taken with six ships only. In Plate
III. Dr. <i>Shebbeare</i>, with fetters on, is prompting
the idiot; and in Plate IV. the old Duke of <i>Newcastle</i>
appears at a window. A happy parody in the
last of these plates may, perhaps, have escaped the
notice of common observers. <i>Le Brun</i>, in his battle
of the <i>Granicus</i>, has represented an eagle hovering
above the laurel'd helmet of <i>Alexander. Hogarth</i> has
painted a goose flying over the periwig'd head of the
successful candidate. During the contested <i>Oxfordshire</i>
election in 1754, an outrageous mob in the Old
Interest had surrounded a post-chaise, and was about
to throw it into the river; when Captain <i>T&mdash;&mdash;</i>,
within-side, shot a chimney-sweeper who was most
active in the assault. The captain was tried and acquitted.
To this fact <i>Hogarth</i> is supposed to allude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
in the Monkey riding on the Bear, with a cockade
in his hat, and a carbine by his side, which goes off
and kills the little sweep, who has clambered up on
the wall. The member chaired is said to bear more
than an accidental resemblance to Mr. <i>Dodington</i>,
afterwards Lord <i>Melcombe</i>.</p>

few variations are discoverable. The perspective in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the oval over the stag's horns is improved. A shadow
on the wainscot, proceeding from a supposed window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
on the left side, is effaced; the hand of the
beldam kissing the young candidate, is removed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
under her apron, and now dangles by her side: a
saltseller is likewise missing from the table. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
first impression also, the butcher who is pouring gin
on the broken head of another man, has <i>For our</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
<i>Country</i> on his cockade; in the second we find <i>Pro
Patria</i> in its stead. The lemons and oranges that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
once lay on a paper, by the tub in which the boy is
making punch, are taken away; because <i>Hogarth</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
in all probability, had been informed that vitriol, or
cream of tartar, is commonly used, instead of vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
acids, when a great quantity of such liquor is
prepared at public houses on public occasions. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the third impression a hat is added to those before on
the ground, and another on the bench. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
plate has also lost much of its former clearness. The
original inscription at one corner of it was&mdash;"Painted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
and <i>the whole</i> engraved by <i>Wm. Hogarth</i>."<a name="FNanchor_5_275" id="FNanchor_5_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_275" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
two Words in <i>Italicks</i> were afterwards effaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>I may here observe, that this performance, in its
original state, is by far the most finished and laborious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
of all <i>Hogarth's</i> engravings. Having been two years
on sale (from 1755 to 1757) it was considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
worn before the publication of Plate the second;
and was afterwards touched and retouched till almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
all the original and finer traces of the burin
were either obliterated or covered by succeeding ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
In short, there is the same difference between the
earliest and latest impressions, as there was between
the first and second state of Sir <i>John Cutler's</i> stockings,
which, by frequent mending, from silk degenerated
into worsted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>I learn also, on the best authority, that our artist,
who was always fond of trying to do what no man
had ventured to do before him, resolved to finish
this plate without taking a single proof from it as he
proceeded in his operation. The consequence of
his temerity was, that he almost spoiled his performance.
When he discovered his folly, he raved,
stamped, and swore he was ruined, nor could be prevailed
on to think otherwise, till his passion subsided,
and a brother artist assisted him in his efforts to remedy
the general defect occasioned by such an attempt
to perform an impossibility.</p>

<p>In Plate II. we meet with a fresh proof of our
artist's inattention to orthography; <i>Party-tool</i> (used
as a proper name) being here spelt parti-tool. This
plate was engraved by <i>C. Grignion</i>, and has been retouched,
as the upper-row of the lion's teeth are
quite obliterated in the second impression.</p>

<p>Plate III. The militia (or, as <i>Hogarth</i> spells it,
milicia) bill appearing out of the pocket of the
maimed voter, is only found in the second impression.
This print was engraved by <i>Hogarth</i> and <i>Le Cave</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_276" id="FNanchor_6_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_276" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The dead man, whom they are bringing up as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
voter, alludes to an event of the same kind that
happened during the contested election between <i>Bosworth</i>
and <i>Selwyn</i>. "Why," says one of the clerks,
"you have brought us here a dead man."&mdash;"Dead!"
cries the bringer; "dead as you suppose him, you
shall soon hear him vote for <i>Bosworth</i>." On this,
a thump was given to the body, which, being full of
wind, emitted a sound that was immediately affirmed
to be a distinct, audible, and good vote for the candidate
already mentioned.&mdash;This circumstance, however,
might have reference to the behaviour of the
late Dr. <i>Barrowby</i>, who persuaded a dying patient
he was so much better, that he might venture with
him in his chariot to go and poll for Sir <i>George
Vandeput</i> in <i>Covent-Garden</i>. The unhappy voter
took his physician's advice, but expired in an hour
after his return from the hustings. "If <i>Hogarth</i>,"
says Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, "had an emblematic thought, he
expressed it with wit, rather than by a symbol.
Such is that of the whore setting fire to the world
in <i>The Rake's Progress</i>. Once indeed he descended
to use an allegoric personage, and was not happy
in it. In one of his Election prints [plate III.]
<i>Britannia's</i> chariot breaks down, while the coachman
and footman are playing at cards on the
box."</p>

<p>In the second impressions of Plate IV.<a name="FNanchor_7_277" id="FNanchor_7_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_277" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> (which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
engraved by <i>W. Hogarth</i> and <i>F. Aviline</i>) the shadow
on the sun-dial, denoting the hour, and the word
indintur (commonly spelt indenture) on the scroll
hanging out at the attorney's window, are both
added. The fire from the gun is also continued
farther; the bars of the church-gate are darkened;
and the upper sprigs of a tree, which were bare at
first, are covered with leaves.</p>

<p>By these marks, the unskilful purchaser may distinguish
the early from the later impressions. I forbear
therefore to dwell on more minute variations.
The ruined house adjoining to the attorney's, intimating
that nothing can thrive in the neighbourhood
of such vermin, is a stroke of satire that should
not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The publick were so impatient for this set of
prints, that <i>Hogarth</i> was perpetually hastening his
coadjutors, changing some, and quarrelling with
others. Three of the plates therefore were slightly
executed, and soon needed the reparations they have
since received.</p>

<p>The following curious address appeared in the
<i>Public Advertiser</i> of <i>Feb.</i> 28, 1757.</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> is obliged to inform the subscribers
to his Election Prints, that the three last cannot be
published till about <i>Christmas</i> next, which delay
is entirely owing to the difficulties he has met with
to procure able hands to engrave the plates; but
that he neither may have any more apologies to
make on such an account, nor trespass any further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
on the indulgence of the public by encreasing
a collection already sufficiently large, he intends to
employ the rest of his time in portrait-painting;
chiefly this notice seems more necessary, as several
spurious and scandalous prints<a name="FNanchor_8_278" id="FNanchor_8_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_278" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> have lately been
published in his name.</p>

<p>"All Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> engraved works are to be had
at his house in <i>Leicester-fields</i>, separate or together;
as also his Analysis of Beauty, in 4to. with two
explanatory prints, price 15<i>s.</i> With which will
be delivered gratis, an eighteen-penny pamphlet
published by <i>A. Miller</i>, called <i>The Investigator</i>,
written in opposition to the principles laid down
in the above Analysis of Beauty, by <i>A. R.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_279" id="FNanchor_9_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_279" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a
friend to Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, an eminent portrait-painter
now of <i>Rome</i>."</p>

<p>The foregoing advertisement appears to have been
written during the influence of a fit of spleen or disappointment,
for nothing else could have dictated to
our artist so absurd a resolution as that of quitting a
walk he had trod without a rival, to re-enter another
in which he had by no means distinguished himself
from the herd of common painters.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_264" id="Footnote_1_264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_264"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I learn from <i>The Grub-street Journal</i> for <i>June</i> 13, 1734,
that the same subject had been attempted by an earlier hand,
under the title of <i>The Humours of a Country Election</i>. The description
of some of the compartments of this work (which I
have not seen) bears particular resemblance to the scenes represented
by <i>Hogarth</i>. "The candidates very complaisant to a
<i>Country Clown</i>, &amp;c."&mdash;"The candidates making an entertainment
for the electors and their wives.&mdash;At the upper
end of the table the <i>Parson</i> of the Parish, &amp;c."</p></div>

of the Admiralty; afterwards Sir <i>George Hay</i>, knight,
Dean of the Arches, Judge of the Prerogative Court, and
also of the High Court of Admiralty, who died <i>October</i> 6,
1778, aged 63. He was possessed of several of <i>Hogarth's</i>
paintings, which are now the property of Mr. <i>Edwards</i>, and
have been mentioned in p. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>. Our honourable Judge has
the following character in a work of great authority.

<p>
On the trial of her Grace the Duchess of <i>Kingston</i>, for bigamy,
before the House of Lords, in <i>April</i> 1776, the present
Lord Chancellor <i>Thurlow</i> (then Attorney-General) thus speaks
of Sir <i>George</i> as a judge:&mdash;"The most loose and unconsidered
notion, escaping in any manner from that able and excellent
judge, should be received with respect, and certainly will;
if the question were my own, with the choice of my court,
I should refer it to his decision." State Trials, XI. 221.</p></div>

Permit a Bard, though screen'd his name,<br />
To court the sanction of your fame;<br />
Pursue your genius, taste, and art,<br />
And knowledge of the human heart:<br />
Just as your pencil, could my pen<br />
But trace the various ways of men;<br />
Express the tokens of the mind,<br />
The humours, follies, of mankind;<br />
Then might Thyself this verse regard,<br />
Nor deem beneath the task the bard:<br />
Yet, though unfit, perhaps unknown,<br />
I supplicate thy aid alone:<br />
Let others all the Nine inspire,<br />
Do Thou, O <i>Hogarth</i>, tune my lyre!<br />
Let o'er my thoughts thy spirit shine,<br />
And thy vast fancy waken mine:<br />
I feel the genuine influence now!<br />
It glows!&mdash;my great <i>Apollo</i> Thou!<br />
<br />
The Writs are issued:&mdash;to the Town<br />
The future Members hasten down;<br />
The merry bells their welcome sound,<br />
And mirth and jollity abound,<br />
The gay retinue now comes in,<br />
The crouds, with emulative din,<br />
Proclaim th' arrival, rend the sky,<br />
And <i>Court</i> and <i>Country's</i> all the cry.<br />
Each joyous house, of free access,<br />
For patriot plebeians, more or less,<br />
Is now reveal'd, in printed bills;<br />
So quacks contrive to vend their pills.<br />
So <i>Bayes</i> makes Earth, and Sun, and Moon,<br />
Discourse melodiously in tune;<br />
And, full of wit and complaisance,<br />
Cry, "First of all we'll have a dance!"<br />
So at Elections 'tis discreet<br />
Still first of all to have a treat;<br />
The pulse of every man to try,<br />
And learn what votes they needs must <i>buy</i>;<br />
No freeman well can tell his side,<br />
Unless his belly's satisfied.<br />
<br />
Behold the festive tables set,<br />
The Candidates, the Voters met!<br />
And lo, against the wainscot plac'd,<br />
Th' escutcheon, with three guineas grac'd,<br />
The motto and the crest explain,<br />
Which way the gilded bait to gain.<br />
There <i>William's</i> mangled portrait tells<br />
What rage in party bosoms dwells;<br />
And here the banner speaks the cry<br />
For "Liberty and Loyalty."<br />
While scratches dignify his face,<br />
The tipsy Barber tells his case;<br />
How well he for his Honour fought!<br />
How many devilish knocks he got!<br />
While, forc'd to carry on the joke,<br />
The 'Squire's just blinded with the smoke;<br />
And gives his hand (for all are free)<br />
To one that's cunninger than he:<br />
With smart cockade, and waggish laugh,<br />
He thinks himself more wise by half.<br />
See <i>Crispin</i>, and his blouzy <i>Kate</i>,<br />
Attack the other Candidate!<br />
What joy he feels her head to lug!<br />
"Well done, my <i>Katy!</i> coaxing pug!"<br />
But who is this pray?&mdash;<i>Abel Squatt</i>&mdash;<br />
What has the honest Quaker got?<br />
Why, presents for each voter's lady,<br />
To make their interest sure and steady:<br />
For right and well their Honours know<br />
What things the Petticoat can do.<br />
Discordant sounds now grate the ear,<br />
For music's hir'd to raise the cheer;<br />
And fiddling <i>Nan</i> brisk scrapes her strings,<br />
While <i>Thrumbo's</i> bass loud echoing rings,<br />
And <i>Sawney's</i> bagpipes squeaking trill<br />
"God save the King," or what you will.<br />
Music can charm the savage breast,<br />
And lull the fiercest rage to rest;<br />
But <i>Sawney's</i> face bespeaks it plain,<br />
That vermin don't regard the strain;<br />
A creature, well to <i>Scotchmen</i> known,<br />
Now nips him by the collar-bone:<br />
Ah, luckless louse! in ambush lie,<br />
Or, by St. <i>Andrew</i>, you must die!<br />
<br />
Ye vers'd in men and manners! tell<br />
Why Parsons always eat so well!<br />
Catch they the spirit from the Gown,<br />
To cram so many plate-fulls down?<br />
The feast is o'er with all the rest,<br />
But Mayor and Parson still contest:<br />
I'll hold a thousand!&mdash;Lay the bett&mdash;<br />
The odds are on the Parson yet:<br />
Huzza! the Black-gown wins the day!&mdash;<br />
The Mayor with oysters dies away!&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_A_268" id="FNanchor_A_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_268" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><br />
But softly, don't exult so fast,<br />
His spirit's noble to the last;<br />
His mouth still waters at the dish;<br />
His hand still holds his favourite fish:<br />
Bleed him the Barber-surgeon wou'd;<br />
He breathes a vein, but where's the blood?<br />
No more it flows its wonted pace,<br />
And chilly dews spread o'er his face:<br />
The Parson sweats; but be it told,<br />
The sweat is more from heat than cold:<br />
"Bring me the chafing-dish!" he cries;<br />
'Tis brought; the savoury fumes arise:<br />
"My last tit-bit's delicious so;<br />
Can oysters vie with venison?"&mdash;No.<br />
<br />
Behold, through sympathy of face,<br />
(In life a very common case)<br />
His Lordship gives the fidler wine!<br />
"Come, brother <i>Chinny!</i> yours and mine:"<br />
And o'er a pretty girl confest,<br />
The Alderman, see! toasts "the best."<br />
Ye hearty cocks! who feel the gout,<br />
Yet briskly push the glass about,<br />
Observe, with crutch behind his chair,<br />
Your honest brother <i>Chalkstone</i> there!<br />
His phiz declares he seems to strain;<br />
Perhaps the gravel gives him pain:<br />
But be it either that or this,<br />
One thing is certain&mdash;he's at * * * *,<br />
A wag, the merriest in the town,<br />
Whose face was never meant to frown,<br />
See, at his straining makes a scoff!<br />
And, singing, takes his features off;<br />
While clowns, with joy and wonder, stare,<br />
"Gad-zookers! <i>Roger</i>, look ye there!"<br />
The busy Clerk the Taylor plies,<br />
"Vote for his Honour, and be wise:<br />
These yellow-boys are all your own!"<br />
But he, with puritanic tone,<br />
Cries, "<i>Satan!</i> take thy bribes from me;<br />
Why this were downright perjury!"<br />
His wife, with all-sufficient tongue,<br />
For rage and scandal glibly hung,<br />
Replies, "Thou blockhead! gold refuse,<br />
When here's your child in want of shoes!"<br />
<br />
But hark! what uproar strikes the ear!<br />
Th' opposing mob, incens'd, draw near:<br />
Their waving tatter'd ensigns see!<br />
Here "Liberty and Property:"<br />
A label'd <i>Jew</i> up-lifted high;<br />
There "Marry all, and multiply."<br />
These, these, are patrotic scenes!<br />
But not a man knows what he means.<br />
The jordan drives their zeal to cool,<br />
With added weight of three-legg'd stool;<br />
But all in vain; and who can't eat,<br />
Now sally out the foe to beat;<br />
For glory be the battle try'd;<br />
Huzza! my boys, the <i>yellow</i> side.<br />
Observe the loyal work begin,<br />
And stones and brick-bats enter in!<br />
That knocks a rustic veteran down;<br />
This cracks the Secretary's crown;<br />
His minute-book, of special note,<br />
For every sure, and doubtful vote,<br />
Now tumbles; ink the table dyes,<br />
And backward poor Pill-Garlick lies.<br />
The Butcher, one who ne'er knew dread,<br />
A Surgeon turns for t'other's head;<br />
His own already broke and bound,<br />
Yet with <i>pro patria</i> decked around.<br />
Behold what wonders gin can do,<br />
External and internal too!<br />
He thinks a plaster but a jest;<br />
All cure with what they like the best:<br />
Pour'd on, it sooths the patient's pain;<br />
Pour'd in, it makes him fight again.<br />
His toes perchance pop out his shoe,<br />
Yet he's a patriot through and through;<br />
His lungs can for his party roar,<br />
As loud as twenty men, or more.<br />
Ye courtiers! give your <i>Broughton</i> praise;<br />
The hero of your eleven days,<br />
'Tis his to trim th'opposers round,<br />
And bring their standard to the ground.<br />
The waiting-boy, astonish'd, eyes<br />
What gin the new-turn'd quack applies;<br />
And fills a tub, that glorious punch<br />
May make amends for blow and hunch.<br />
But stop, my lad, put in no more,<br />
For t'other side are near the door;<br />
Nor will their conscience deem it sin,<br />
To guzzle all, if once they're in.<br />
<br />
Reader, perhaps thy peaceful mind<br />
Is not to noise or blood inclin'd;<br />
Then, lest some hurt should happen quick,<br />

<br />
Free'd from the madness of the throng,<br />
Now, gentle Reader, come along;<br />
A broken head's no clever joke&mdash;<br />
Sir, welcome to <i>The Royal Oak</i>;<br />
Together let us look about&mdash;&mdash;<br />
We'll find that Show-cloth's meaning out.<br />
<br />
Satire! 'tis thine, with keenest dart,<br />
To shoot the follies of the heart;<br />
And, issuing from the press or stage,<br />
Reclaim the vain, the culprit age!<br />
From <i>Rich's</i> dome, of grand renown,<br />
To thatch-torn barn, in country town;<br />
From <i>Garrick</i>, monarch of his art,<br />
To <i>Punch</i>, so comical and smart;<br />
Satire delights, in every sphere,<br />
To make men laugh at what they <i>are</i>:<br />
"Walk in, the only show in town;<br />
<i>Punch</i> candidate for <i>Guzzle-down</i>!"<br />
There see the pile, in modern taste,<br />
On top with tub-like turret grac'd!<br />
Where the cramp'd entrance, like some shed,<br />
Knocks off the royal driver's head;<br />
Lives there a Wit but what will cry,<br />
"An arch so <i>low</i> is mighty <i>high</i>!"<br />
See from the Treasury flows the gold,<br />
To shew that those who're <i>bought</i> are <i>sold</i>!<br />
Come, Perjury, meet it on the road,<br />
'Tis all your own; a waggon-load.<br />
Ye party-tools, ye courtier-tribe,<br />
Who gain no vote without a bribe,<br />
Lavishly kind, yet insincere,<br />
Behold in <i>Punch</i> yourselves appear!<br />
And you, ye fools, who poll for pay,<br />
Ye little great men of a day;<br />
For whom your favourite will not care,<br />
Observe how much bewitch'd you are!<br />
<br />
Yet hush!&mdash;for see his Honour near;&mdash;<br />
Truly, a pretty amorous leer:<br />
The ladies both look pleasant too;<br />
"Purchase some trinkets of the <i>Jew</i>."<br />
One points to what she'd have him buy;<br />
The other casts a longing eye;<br />
And <i>Shylock</i>, money-loving soul,<br />
Impatient waits to touch the cole:<br />
But here's a Porter; what's the news?&mdash;<br />
Ha, ha, a load of billet-doux!<br />
Humbly to sue th' Electors' favour,<br />
With vows of <i>Cato</i>-like behaviour;<br />
And how the Borough he'll espouse,<br />
When once a Member of the House:<br />
Though wiser folks will lay a bet,<br />
His promises he'll then forget.<br />
But pray your Honour condescend<br />
An eye on kneeling <i>Will</i> to lend;<br />
Grant to the fair the toys they chuse,<br />
And what the letter says, peruse:<br />
"To <i>Timothy Parti-tool</i>, Esquire."&mdash;<br />
Your title may in time be higher.<br />
<br />
Ha, who stands here?&mdash;'Tis Farmer <i>Rye</i>,<br />
A man of cunning, by the bye;<br />
In times like this a mighty stirrer,&mdash;<br />
Of some small interest in the Borough.<br />
Which side? you ask&mdash;the question's well,<br />
But more, as yet, than he can tell.<br />
The <i>hosts</i> of either party try;<br />
To both he casts a <i>knowing</i> eye.<br />
"Sir, I'm commission'd by the 'Squire&mdash;<br />
Your company they all desire:<br />
My house contains near half the town&mdash;<br />
'Tis just at hand, Sir;&mdash;'tis <i>The Crown.</i>"<br />
Then t'other cries, "Sure I first spoke&mdash;<br />

<br />
Which party shall the voter take,<br />

Troth, cunning <i>Fatty</i>, you have won;<br />
Success in that sly glance is shown;<br />
The honest Farmer's all your own:<br />
But don't exult; for, being loth<br />
To disoblige, he takes from both.<br />
<br />
Oh, <i>Britain</i>! favourite Isle of Heaven,<br />
When to thy Sons shall Peace be given?<br />
The treachery of the <i>Gallic</i> shore<br />
Makes even thy wooden lions roar.<br />
That royal beast, who many a league<br />
At sea hath sail'd with vengeance big!<br />
And oft has scar'd the hostile coast,<br />

Still keeps his furious power in use;<br />
Devouring of the <i>Flower-de-luce</i>.<br />
How certain those expanded paws!<br />
How dreadful those extended jaws!<br />
Behind him sits the Hostess fair,<br />
Counting her cash with earned care;<br />
While at the door the Grenadier<br />
Inspects her with a cunning leer;<br />
As who should say, "When we're alone,<br />
Some part of that will be my own!"<br />
<br />
But who are those two in the Bar?<br />
Guttlers I fancy&mdash;that they are;<br />
The fowl to Him's a noble feast;<br />
He sure makes mouths, to mock the beast;<br />
And t'other hopes to find relief,<br />
By eating half the round of beef.<br />
<br />
From <i>George</i>, who wears the <i>British</i> crown,<br />
To the remotest country clown,<br />
The love of politics extends,<br />
And oft makes foes of nearest friends.<br />
The Cobler and the Barber there,<br />
That born to frown, and this to stare,<br />
Both positive, you need not doubt,<br />
Will argue till they both fall out.<br />
<br />
"Well," says the Tonsor, "now we'll try,<br />
Who's in the right, yourself or I:<br />
One moment let your tongue be still,<br />
Or else be judg'd by <i>Johnny Hill:<br />
Vernon</i> he thought a glorious fellow,<br />
Which made him put up <i>Porto Bello</i>.<br />
I'll teach you reason, if I can&mdash;<br />
I should though shave the Gentleman;<br />
But never mind it, let him wait;&mdash;<br />
These bits of pipe the case shall state"&mdash;<br />
<br />
"Drink," cries the Cobler, "I'm adry;<br />
Pshaw, damn your nonsense, what care I?<br />
I told you first, and all along,<br />
I'll lay this cole you're in the wrong;<br />
I hope his worship will excuse,<br />
I should, though, carry home his shoes."<br />
<br />
"Well, well," the Barber makes reply,<br />
"Election-time puts business by:<br />
Only six ships our Admiral had;<br />
A very slender force, egad;<br />
What then? our dumplings gave them sport:&mdash;<br />
Here stood one castle; there the fort."&mdash;<br />
<br />
"'Sblood," cries the Cobler, "go to school,<br />
You half-learn'd, half-starv'd, silly fool!<br />
I tell you, Barber, 'tis not true;<br />
Sure I can see as much as you."<br />
<br />
But hark, what noise our ears assails!<br />
A distant, loud huzza, prevails;<br />
Ha, ha, they're at their wonted sport;<br />
That was a gun, by the report:<br />
Behold the rabble at <i>The Crown</i>!<br />
"Damn, damn, th' Excise; we'll have it down."<br />
And all the while, poor simple elves,<br />
They little think 'twill crush themselves.<br />
Danger again may wait our stay,<br />
So, courteous Reader, come away.<br />

<i>Swift</i>, reverend wag, <i>Ierne's</i> pride,<br />
Who lov'd the comic rein to guide,<br />
Has told us, "Gaolers, when they please,<br />
Let out their flock, to rob for fees."<br />
From this sage hint, in needful cases,<br />
The wights, who govern other places,<br />
Let out their crew, for private ends,<br />
<i>Ergo</i>, to serve themselves and friends.<br />
Behold, here gloriously inclin'd,<br />
The Sick, and Lame, the Halt, and Blind!<br />
From Workhouse, Gaol, and Hospital,<br />
Submiss they come, true Patriots all!<br />
<br />
But let's get nearer, while we stay,&mdash;<br />
Good Master Constable, make way!<br />
"Hoi! keep the passage clear and fair;&mdash;<br />
I'll break your shins!&mdash;stand backward there;<br />
What! won't you let the Pollers come:"&mdash;<br />
Reader, they think us so&mdash;but <i>mum</i>.<br />
<br />
Now praise and prejudice expand,<br />
In printed bills, from hand to hand;<br />
One tells, the 'Squire's a man of worth;<br />
Generous and noble from his birth:<br />
Another plainly makes appear,<br />
"Some circumstance, in such a year."<br />
The voice of Scandal's sure to wait,<br />
Or true, or false, each Candidate.<br />
Observe the waving flags applied,<br />
To let Free-holders know their side!<br />
Hark, at each vote exult the crew!<br />
"<i>Yellow!</i> Huzza!&mdash;Huzza! the <i>Blue!</i>"<br />
<br />
Whoe'er has walk'd through <i>Chelsea</i> town,<br />
Which Buns and Charity renown,<br />
Has many a College Veteran seen,<br />
With scar-seam'd face, and batter'd mien,<br />
But here's a theme for future story!<br />
Survey that Son of <i>Mars</i> before ye!<br />
Was ever Pensioner like him?&mdash;<br />
What, almost robb'd of every limb!<br />
Only one arm, one leg, one thigh;<br />
Gods! was that man design'd to die?<br />
Inspect his ancient, war-like face!<br />
See, with what surly, manly grace,<br />
He gives the Clerk to understand<br />
His meaning, with his wooden hand!<br />
Perhaps in <i>Anna's</i> glorious days,<br />
His courage gain'd immortal praise:<br />
<i>Britons</i>, a people brave and rough,<br />
That time lov'd fighting well enough;<br />
And, glad their native land to aid,<br />
Leg-making was a thriving trade;<br />
But now we from ourselves depart,<br />
And war's conducted with new art;<br />
Our Admirals, Generals, learn to run,<br />
And Leg-makers are all undone.<br />
Still he's an open, hearty blade,<br />
Pleas'd with his sword, and gay cockade:<br />
Unbrib'd he votes; and 'tis his pride;<br />
He always chose the honest side.<br />
You think he seems of man but half,<br />
But, witty Clerk, suppress your laugh;<br />
His heart is in its usual place,<br />
And that same hook may claw your face.<br />
How learnedly that Lawyer pleads!<br />
"A vote like this, Sir, ne'er succeeds;<br />
The naked hand should touch the book;<br />
Observe h'as only got a hook."<br />
"Sir," cries the other, "that's his hand;"<br />
(Quibbles, like you, I understand)<br />
"And be it either flesh or wood,<br />
By Heavens! his vote is very good."<br />
Wise Counsellor! you reason right,<br />
You'll gain undoubted credit by't;<br />
But please to turn your head about,<br />
And find that Idiot's meaning out;<br />
Dismiss the Whisperer from his chair,<br />
'Tis quite illegal, quite unfair;<br />
Though shackles on his legs are hung,<br />
Those shackles can't confine his tongue;<br />
Methinks I hear him tell the Nisey,<br />
"Be sure to vote as I advise ye;<br />
My writings shew I'm always right;<br />
The nation sinks; we're ruin'd quite<br />
<i>America's</i> entirely lost;<br />
The <i>French</i> invade our native coast;<br />
Our Ministers won't keep us free;&mdash;-<br />
You know all this as well as me.<br />
All men of parts are out of place;<br />
'Tis mine, 'tis many a wise man's case;<br />
And though so <i>Cato</i>-like I write,<br />
I ne'er shall get a farthing by't."<br />
Good Clerk, dispatch them quick, I pray:<br />
How easy fools are led astray!<br />
He thinks th' insinuation's true,<br />
As all the race of Idiots do.<br />
But who comes here? Ha, one just dead,<br />
Ravish'd from out th' infirmary's bed;<br />
Through racking follies sad and sick,<br />
Yet to the cause he'll ever stick;<br />
Tie the groat favour on his cap,<br />
And die True Blue, whate'er may hap.<br />
<br />
Oh, Vice! through life extends thy reign:<br />
When Custom fixes thy domain,<br />
Not <i>Wesley's</i> cant, nor <i>Whitfield's</i> art,<br />
Can chace thee from th' envelop'd heart!<br />
Behold that wretch! whom <i>Venus</i> knows<br />
Has in her revels lost his nose;<br />
Still with that season'd Nurse he toys;<br />
As erst indulges sensual joys;<br />
Can drink, and crack a bawdy joke,<br />
And still can quid, as well as smoke.<br />
But, Nurse, don't smile so in his face;<br />
Sure this is not a proper place;<br />
Take from your duggs his hand away,<br />
And mind your sick-charge better, pray;<br />
Consider, if his faithful side<br />
Should hear that in their cause he died,<br />
They'd be so much enrag'd, I vow,<br />
They'd punish you!&mdash;the Lord knows how.<br />
Beside, you take up too much room,<br />
That boy-led Blind-man wants to come;<br />
And 'scap'd from wars, and foreign clutches,<br />
An Invalid's behind on crutches.<br />
<br />
The man whose fortune suits his wish,<br />
A glutton at each favourite dish;<br />
Who, when o'er venison, ne'er will spare it,<br />
And washes down some rounds with claret;<br />
That man will have a portly belly,<br />
And be of consequence, they tell ye;<br />
Grandeur shall 'tend his air and gait,<br />
And make him like&mdash;that Candidate:<br />
Observe him on the hustings sit!<br />
Fatigu'd, he sweats, or seems to sweat;<br />
Scratching his pate, with shook-back wig,<br />
And puffs, and blows, extremely big:<br />
Perhaps that paper hints about<br />
Votes, whose legality's a doubt;<br />
And will by scrutiny be try'd,<br />
Unless they're on the proper side.<br />
Stiff as if <i>Rackstraw</i>,<a name="FNanchor_B_269" id="FNanchor_B_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_269" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> fam'd for skill,<br />
For genius, taste, or what you will,<br />
With temper'd plaister, stood in haste,<br />
From his set face to form the cast;<br />
Resting on oak-stick stedfastly,<br />
The other would-be Member see!<br />
Struck with his look, so fix'd and stout,<br />
That Wag resolves to sketch it out;<br />
Laughing, they view the pencil'd phiz.&mdash;<br />
"'Tis very like him&mdash;that it is."<br />
Hark to yon hawker with her songs!<br />
"The Gallows shall redress our wrongs!"<br />
I warrant, wrote in humourous style;<br />
The hearers laugh; the readers smile.<br />
And lo, although so thick the rout,<br />
They've room to push the glass about!<br />
Variety her province keeps;<br />
One Beadle watches; t'other sleeps.<br />
<br />
But see that chariot! who rides there?<br />
<i>Britannia</i>, Sir, a lady fair:<br />
To her celestial charms are given;<br />
Ador'd on earth, beloved in heaven;<br />
Her frown makes nations dread a fall;<br />
Her smile gives joy and life to all.<br />
Too generous, merciful, and kind;<br />
Her Servants won't their duty mind;<br />
Neither their Mistress' call regards;<br />
Their study's how to cheat at cards;<br />
The reins of power, oh, indiscreet!<br />
They trample, careless, under feet;<br />
Th' unguided coursers neigh and spurn,<br />
And ah, the car must overturn!<br />
Just gods, forbid!&mdash;there's comfort yet!<br />
For, lo, how near that saving <span class="smcap">Pitt</span>!<br />
Sure Heaven design'd her that resource,<br />
To stop her venal servants course;<br />
Her peace and safety to restore,<br />
And keep from dangers evermore.<br />
<br />
Ha! see, yon distant cavalcade!<br />
Exulting crowds, and flags display'd!<br />
Let's to the bridge our foot-steps bend&mdash;<br />
So cheek by jole, along, my friend.<br />

Enter'd in triumph <i>Babylon</i>,<br />

Yet Time proclaims <i>We must</i><a name="FNanchor_C_270" id="FNanchor_C_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_270" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> do so.<br />

To draw the gaping bumpkins in."<a name="FNanchor_D_271" id="FNanchor_D_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_271" class="fnanchor">[D]</a><br />
<i>Minerva's</i> sacred bird's an owl;<br />
Our candidate's, behold, a fowl!<br />
From which we readily suppose<br />
(As now his generous Honour's chose)<br />
His voice he'll in the Senate use;<br />
And cackle, cackle, like&mdash;a goose.<br />
<br />
But, hark ye! you who bear this load<br />
Of patriot worth along the road,<br />
Methinks you make his Honour lean;<br />
Be careful, Sirs!&mdash;Zounds! what d' ye mean?<br />
Off flies his hat, back leans his chair,<br />
And dread of falling makes him stare.<br />
His Lady, fond to see him ride,<br />
With Nurse and <i>Black-moor</i> at her side,<br />
In church-yard stands to view the sight,<br />
And at his danger's in a fright.<br />
"Alack, alack, she faints away!"<br />
"The hartshorn, <i>Ora</i>&mdash;quick, I say!"<br />
See, at yon house th' opposing party<br />
Enjoy the joke, with laughter hearty!<br />
"Well done, my boys&mdash;now let him fall;<br />
Here's gin and porter for you all!"<br />
<br />
But let's find whence this came about:<br />
Ha, lo, that Thresher bold and stout!<br />
How, like a hero, void of dread,<br />
He aims to crack that sailor's head!<br />
While, with the purchase of the stroke,<br />
Behind, the bearer's pate is broke:<br />
The sailor too resolves to drub,<br />
Wrathful he sways the ponderous club;<br />
Who to stir up his rage shall dare?<br />
He'll fight for ever&mdash;for his Bear.<br />
<br />
Sir <i>Hudibras</i> agreed, Bear-baiting<br />
Was carnal, and of man's creating;<br />
But, had he like that Thresher done,<br />
I'll hold a wager, ten to one,<br />
His knighthood had not kept him safe;<br />
That Tar had trimm'd both him and <i>Ralph</i>.<br />
<br />
In fighting <i>George's</i> glorious battles,<br />
To save our liberties and chattels;<br />
Commanded by some former <i>Howe</i>,<br />
Ordain'd to make proud <i>Gallia</i> bow,<br />
A cannon-ball took off his leg:<br />
What then? he scorns, like some, to beg;<br />
That muzzled beast is taught to dance,<br />
That Ape to ape the beaux of <i>France</i>;<br />
The countryfolks admire the sport,<br />
And small collections pay him for't.<br />
Sailors and Soldiers ne'er agree;&mdash;<br />
There's difference twixt the Land and Sea;<br />
He, willing not a jest shall 'scape,<br />
In uniform riggs out his Ape:&mdash;<br />
From which we reasonably infer<br />
An Ape may be an Officer.<br />
But, hey-day! more disasters still?<br />
Turn quick thy head, bold sailor <i>Will</i>.<br />
In vain that fellow, on his Ass,<br />
Attempts to Hogs at home to pass,<br />
The hungry Bear, who thinks no crime<br />
To feast on guts at any time,<br />
Arrests the garbage in the tub,<br />
And with his snout begins to grub.<br />
Pray is it friendly, honest brother,<br />
That one Ass thus should ride another?<br />
The beast seems wearied with his toil,<br />
And, like the bear, would munch a while.<br />
The good wife thought that every pig<br />
Should in the wash, then coming, swig;<br />
And went industriously to find<br />
Her family of the hoggish kind;<br />
But, oh, unhappy fate to tell!<br />
Behind the Thresher down she fell:<br />
Indeed the wonder were no more,<br />
Had she, by chance, fall'n down before:<br />
Away the sow affrighted runs,<br />
Attended by her little ones:<br />
Those gruntings to each other sounding;<br />
This squeaking shrill, through fear of drowning.<br />
<br />
"The lamb thou doom'st to bleed to-day,<br />
Had he thy reason, wou'd he play?"<a name="FNanchor_E_272" id="FNanchor_E_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_272" class="fnanchor">[E]</a><br />
And did that Bear know he'd be beat,<br />
Would he from out that firkin eat?<br />
The Ass's rider lifts his stick;<br />
Take out your nose, old <i>Bruin</i>, quick;<br />
A grin of vengeance arms his face,<br />
Presaging torture, and disgrace.<br />
The Ape, who dearly loves to ride<br />
On <i>Bruin's</i> back, in martial pride,<br />
Dejected at the sad occasion,<br />
Looks up, with soft commiseration;<br />
As if to speak, "Oh, spare my friend!<br />
Avert that blow you now intend!"<br />
'Tis complaisant, good-natur'd too;&mdash;<br />
Much more than many Apes would do.<br />
<br />
Observe the chimney-sweepers, there!<br />
On gate-post, how they laugh and stare;<br />
Those bones, and emblematic skull,<br />
Have no effect to make them dull;<br />
Pleas'd they adorn the death-like head<br />
With spectacles of gingerbread.<br />
<br />
When <i>London</i> city's bold train-band<a name="FNanchor_F_273" id="FNanchor_F_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_273" class="fnanchor">[F]</a><br />
March, to preserve their track of land,<br />
Each val'rous heart the <i>French</i> defying,<br />
While drums are beating, colours flying,<br />
How many accidents resound<br />
From <i>Tower-hill</i> to th' <i>Artillery-ground!</i><br />
Perhaps some hog, in frisky pranks,<br />
Unluckily breaks through their ranks,<br />
And makes the captain storm and swear,<br />
To <i>form</i> their soldiers, <i>as they were</i>:<br />
Or else the wadding, which they ram,<br />
Pop into some one's ear they jam;<br />
Or not alert at gun and sword,<br />
When their commander gives the word<br />
To fire, amidst the dust and clamour,<br />
Forget to draw their desperate rammer;<br />
And one or two brave comrades hit,<br />
As cooks fix larks upon a spit.<br />
That Monkey's sure not of the reg'ment,<br />
Yet still his arms should have abridgement;<br />
The little, aukward, martial figure,<br />
Will wriggle till he pulls the trigger:<br />
'Tis done&mdash;and see the bullet fly!&mdash;<br />
Pop down, you rogue! or else you'll die.<br />
<br />
Survey, as merry as a grig,<br />
The Fiddler dancing to his jig!<br />
No goat, by good St. <i>David</i> rear'd,<br />
Could ever boast more length of beard:<br />
'Tis his to wait on Master <i>Bruin</i>,<br />
And tune away to all he's doing;<br />
You think this strange, but 'tis no more,<br />
Than <i>Orpheus</i> did in days of yore;<br />
With modern fiddlers so it fares;<br />
They often scratch to dancing-bears.<br />
He took to scraping in his prime,<br />
And plays in tune, as well as time;<br />
Elections cheer his merry heart;<br />
Sure always then to <i>play</i> his <i>part</i>:<br />
In toping healths as great a soaker<br />
As executing <i>Ally Croaker</i>.<br />
Tho' some Musicians scarce can touch<br />
The strings, if drunk a glass too much;<br />
Yet he'll tope ale, or stout <i>October</i>,<br />
And scrape as well when drunk, as sober.<br />
<br />
Lo, on yon stone which shows the way.<br />
That travellers mayn't go astray;<br />
And tells how many miles they lag on,<br />
From <i>London</i>, in the drawling waggon,<br />
A Soldier sits, in naked buff!<br />
In troth, Sir, this is odd enough!<br />
His head bound up, his sword-blade broken,<br />
And flesh with many a bloody token,<br />
Declare he fought extremely well;<br />
But which had best on't, who can tell?<br />
If he were victor, 'tis confest,<br />
To be so maul'd makes bad the best:<br />
What though he smart, he likes the jobb;<br />
'Tis <i>great</i> to head a party-mob.<br />
But what reward for all he did?&mdash;<br />
Oh, Sir, he'll never want a&mdash;<i>quid</i>.<br />
<br />
There's somewhat savory in the wind&mdash;<br />
Those Courtiers, Friend, have not yet din'd:<br />
Their true ally, grave <i>Puzzle-cause</i>,<br />
A man right learned in the laws,<br />
(Whose meagre clerk below can't venture,<br />
And wishes damn'd the long indenture),<br />
As custom bids, prepares the dinner,<br />
For, though they've lost, yet he's the winner.<br />
See, the domestic train appear!<br />
Old <i>England</i> bringing up the rear!<br />
Curse on their stomachs, who can't brook<br />
Good <i>English</i> fare, from <i>English</i> cook!<br />
Observe lank Monsieur, in amaze,<br />
Upon the valiant soldier gaze!<br />
"Morbleu! you love de fight, ve see,<br />
But dat is no de dish for ve."<br />
Behold, above, that azure garter&mdash;<br />
Look, now he whispers, like a tartar;<br />
By button fast he holds the other,<br />
The lost election makes a pother.<br />
"All this parade is idle stuff&mdash;<br />
We know our interest well enough&mdash;<br />
We still support what we espouse;<br />
We'll bring the matter in the <i>House</i>."<br />
<br />
Of some wise man, perhaps philosopher,<br />
(If not, it flings the vice a gloss over)<br />
I've read, who, Maudlin-like, would cry<br />
Soon as he 'ad drunk his barrel dry:<br />
Yon fellow, certain as a gun,<br />
Of that Philosopher's a Son:<br />
Long as the pot the beer could scoop,<br />
He scorn'd, like swine, to trough to stoop;<br />
But, now 'tis shallow, kneels devout,<br />
Eager to suck the last drop out.<br />
Vociferous Loyalty's a-dry,<br />
And, lo, they bear a fresh supply!<br />
That all the mob may roar applause,<br />
And know they'll never starve the cause.<br />
<br />
When grey-mare proves the better horse,<br />
The man is mis'rable of course;<br />
That Taylor leads a precious life&mdash;<br />
Look at the termagant his wife,<br />
She pays him sweetly o'er the head;&mdash;<br />
"Get home, you dog, and get your bread;<br />
Shall I have nothing to appear in,<br />
While you get drunk electioneering?"<br />
<br />
See from the Town-hall press the crowd,<br />
While rustic Butchers ring aloud!<br />
There, lo, their cap of liberty!<br />
Here t'other side in effigy!<br />
A notable device, to call<br />
The Courtier party blockheads all:<br />
Aloft True-Blue, their ensign, flies,<br />
And acclamations rend the skies.<br />
Reflect, my friend, and judge from thence.<br />
How idle this extreme expence;<br />
What mighty sums are thrown away,<br />
To be the pageant of the day!<br />
In vain Desert implores protections;<br />
The Rich are fonder of Elections.<br />
Th' ambitious Peer, the Knight, the 'Squire,<br />
Can buy the Borough they desire;<br />
Yet see, with unassisting eye,<br />
Arts fade away, and Genius die.<br />
Tir'd with the applauding, and the sneering,<br />
And all that's styl'd Electioneering,<br />
I think to take a little tour,<br />
And likely tow'rd the <i>Gallic</i> shore;<br />
The Muse, to whom we bear no malice,<br />
Invites me to the Gate of <i>Calais</i>.<a name="FNanchor_G_274" id="FNanchor_G_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_274" class="fnanchor">[G]</a><br />
That gate to which a knight of worth,<br />
'Yclep'd <i>Sir Loin</i>, of <i>British</i> birth,<br />
Advanc'd, though not in hostile plight,<br />
And put their army in a fright.<br />
But more it fits not, here to tell,<br />
So, courteous Reader, fare thee well.<br />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_268" id="Footnote_A_268"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_268"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> In <i>The European Magazine</i> for the month of <i>Oct.</i> 1784, appears a
letter on the subject of Painting, signed C. I. F. which contains the following
extraordinary criticism on the circumstance here described.
</p>
<p>
"Our own inimitable <i>Hogarth</i> has, in some of his latter pieces,
grossly violated this rule; and, for the sake of crowding his piece
with incidents, has represented what could not happen at all.
</p>
<p>
"In his representation of an Election Feast, he has placed a man at
the end of the table with an oyster still upon his fork, and his fork in
his hand, though his coat must have been stripped up from his arm
after he took it up, by the surgeon, who has made an ineffectual attempt
to let him blood. Supposing gluttony to have so far absorbed
all the persons present, even at the end of a feast, as that none of them
should pay the least attention to this incident, which is, if not impossible,
improbable in the highest degree, they must necessarily have
been alarmed at another incident that is represented as taking place at
the same moment: a great stone has just broke through the window,
and knocked down one of the company, who is exhibited in the act
of falling; yet every one is represented as pursuing his purpose with
the utmost tranquillity."
</p>
<p>
I must entreat my reader to examine the print, before I can expect
belief, when I assure him, that for this criticism there is not the slightest
foundation.&mdash;The magistrate is bled in the right arm, which is bared
for that purpose, by stripping the coat-sleeve from it.&mdash;It is in his left
hand that he holds the fork with the oyster on it, his coat-sleeve being
all the while on his left arm.&mdash;As to the attention of the company, it is
earnestly engaged by different objects; and <i>Hogarth</i> perhaps designed to
insinuate that accidents, arising from repletion or indigestion, are too
common at election dinners to attract notice or excite solicitude.&mdash;The
brickbat has not noisily forced its way through a window, but was
thrown in at a casement already open; and a moment must have elapsed
before an event so instantaneous could be perceived in an assembly, every
individual of which had his distinct avocation. Of this moment our
artist has availed himself. Till, therefore, the accident was discovered,
he has, with the utmost propriety, left every person present to pursue

<p>I should observe, that when this plate was left
with the person employed to furnish the inscription,
he, taking the whole for the production of our artist,
wrote "Engraved by <i>W. Hogarth</i>" under it. <i>Hogarth</i>,
being conscious that the face only had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>

<p>In the second impression "The Face Engraved
by <i>W. Hogarth</i>" is totally omitted.</p>

<p>In the third impression "Serjeant-painter, &amp;c."
is scratched over by the burin, but remains still sufficiently
legible.</p>

With these prints are likewise several early impressions from

<p>1. The Cockpit. <i>Designed and engraved by W.
Hogarth.</i> In this plate is a portrait of <i>Nan Rawlins</i>,
a very ugly old woman (commonly called <i>Deptford
Nan</i>, sometimes the <i>Duchess of Deptford</i>), and well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
remembered at <i>Newmarket</i>. She was a famous cock-feeder,
and did the honours of the <i>gentlemen's</i> ordinary
at <i>Northampton</i>; while, in return, a single gentleman
was deputed to preside at the table appropriated
to the <i>ladies</i>. The figure with a hump-back, was
designed for one <i>Jackson</i>, a once noted jockey
at <i>Newmarket</i>. The blind president is Lord <i>Albemarle
Bertie</i>, who was a constant attender of this
diversion. His portrait was before discoverable in
the crowd round the bruisers in the March to <i>Finchley</i>.</p>

<p>By the cockpit laws, any person who cannot, or
will not pay his debts of honour, is drawn up in a
basket to the roof of the building. Without a knowledge
of this circumstance, the shadow of the man
who is offering his watch would be unintelligible.</p>

<p>The subject of The Cockpit had been recommended
to <i>Hogarth</i> so long ago as 1747, in the following
lines, first printed in <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i> of
that year, p. 292.</p>

Behold a generous train of Cocks repair,<br />
To vie for glory in the toils of war;<br />
Each hero burns to conquer or to die:<br />
What mighty hearts in little bosoms lie!<br />

What forms, what features, human passions wear,<br />

Survey the circling judges of the fight.<br />

Springs to the changing face, exert thy art;<br />
Mix with the smiles of Cruelty at pain<br />
Whate'er looks anxious in the lust of gain;<br />
And say, can aught that's generous, just, or kind,<br />
Beneath this aspect, lurk within the mind?<br />
Is lust of blood or treasure vice in all,<br />
Abhorr'd alike on whomsoe'er it fall?<br />
Are mighty states and gamblers still the same?<br />
And war itself a cock-fight, and a game?<br />
Are sieges, battles, triumphs, little things;<br />

Which fight, in Freedom's cause, still blindly bold,<br />
Bye-battles only, and the main for gold?<br />
<br />
"The crested bird, whose voice awakes the morn,<br />
Whose plumage streaks of radiant gold adorn,<br />

Stalks round, and scowls defiance and disdain.<br />
Not fiercer looks the proud <i>Helvetians</i> wear,<br />
Though thunder slumbers in the arms they bear:<br />
Nor <i>Thracia's</i> fiercer sons, a warlike race!<br />
Display more prowess, or more martial grace.<br />
But, lo! another comes, renown'd for might,<br />
Renown'd for courage, and provokes the fight.<br />
Yet what, alas! avails his furious mien,<br />
His ruddy neck, and breast of varied green?<br />
Soon thro' his brain the foe's bright weapon flies,<br />
Eternal darkness shades his swimming eyes;<br />

While life indignant issues from the wound.<br />

Deny'd thee fame by deeds of martial strife,<br />
Still hadst thou crow'd, for future pleasures spar'd,<br />
Th' exulting monarch of a farmer's yard.<br />
<br />
"Like fate, alas! too soon th' illustrious prove,<br />
The great by hatred fall, the fair by love;<br />
The wise, the good, can scarce preserve a name,<br />
Expung'd by envy from the rolls of fame.<br />
Peace and oblivion still through life secure,<br />
In friendly glooms, the simple, homely, poor.<br />
And who would wish to bask in glory's ray,<br />
To buy with peace the laurel or the bay?<br />
What tho' the wreath defy the lightning's fire,<br />
The bard and hero in the storm expire.<br />
Be rest and innocence my humbler lot,<br />
Scarce known through life, and after death forgot!"<br />

<i>W. Hogarth, July</i> 1760. <i>W. Woollet sculp.</i> Lest any
reader should suppose that this idea of forming a new
capital out of the Star of St. <i>George</i>, the Prince of
<i>Wales's</i> Feather,<a name="FNanchor_2_287" id="FNanchor_2_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_287" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and a regal Coronet, was hatched
in the mind of <i>Hogarth</i> after he had been appointed
Serjeant Painter, the following passage in the <i>Analysis</i>
will prove that many years before he had conceived
the practicability of such an attempt: see p. 40.
"I am thoroughly convinced in myself, however
it may startle some, that a completely new and
harmonious order of architecture in all its parts
might be produced, &amp;c." Again, p. 46. "Even
a capital, composed of the aukward and confined
forms of hats and perriwigs, as Fig. 48. Plate I.
in a skilful hand might be made to have some
beauty." Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i> has the original sketch.</p>

Designer in Perspective to his Majesty.&mdash;"Here is a curious
frontispiece, designed by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>; but not in the same
ludicrous style as the former (see p. <a href="#Page_333">333</a>): it were to be
wished that he had explained its meaning; for, being symbolical,
the meaning of it is not so obvious as the other. To
me it conveys the idea, which <i>Milton</i> so poetically describes,
of the angel <i>Uriel</i> gliding down to Paradise on a sun-beam;
but the young gentleman has dropped off before he had
arrived at his journey's end, with <i>Palladio's</i> book of architecture
on his knees. A ray of light from the sun, rising
over a distant mountain, is directed to a scroll on the ground,
on which are two or three scraps of perspective; over which,
supported by a large block of stone, is the upper part of a
sceptre, broke off; the shaft very obliquely and absurdly
inclined, somewhat resembling the <i>Roman</i> fasces, and girt
above with the Prince of <i>Wales's</i> coronet, as an astragal,
through which the fasces rise, and swell into a crown,
adorned with embroidered stars; this is the principal object,
but most vilely drawn. The ray passes through a
round temple, at a considerable distance, which is also falsly
represented, the curves being for the distance too round,
and consequently the diminution of the columns is too
great. It appears to pass over a piece of water; on this
side the ground is fertile and luxuriant with vegetation,
abounding with trees and shrubs; on the other side it is
rocky and barren.<a name="FNanchor_A_286" id="FNanchor_A_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_286" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> What is indicated by this seems to be,
that, where the arts are encouraged by the rays of royal
favour, they will thrive and flourish; but where they are
neglected, and do not find encouragement, they will droop
and languish." <i>Malton's</i> Appendix to his Treatise on Perspective.</p>

order of Mr. <i>Huggins</i> (after the plate was finished),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
though much against the judgement of the engraver,
who was convinced that a still ground would have
shewn the countenance of the person represented to
much greater advantage. Mr. <i>Major's</i> charge was

his friend, Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, flattered him most agreeably, by
thinking <i>the Farmer and his Family</i> not unworthy of a sketch

<h4>1762.</h4>


<p>1. Credulity, Superstition, and Fanaticism. "<i>Satire
on Methodists.</i>" "For deep and useful satire,"
says Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, "the most sublime of all his
works."</p>

<p>This print, however, contains somewhat more than
a satire on Methodism. <i>Credulity</i> is illustrated by the
figure of the Rabbit-breeder of <i>Godalming</i>, with her
supposed progeny galloping from under her petticoats.
<i>St. André's</i> folly furnished <i>Hogarth</i> with matter
for one of his latest, as well as one of his earliest
performances.</p>

<p>2. The Times. Plate I. In one copy of this print
<i>Henry</i> VIII. is blowing the flames; in another Mr.
<i>Pitt</i> has the same employment: As this design is not
illustrated in <i>Trusler's</i> Account of <i>Hogarth's</i> Works,
I shall attempt its explanation, and subjoin, by
way of note, a humourous description of it, which
was printed in a news-paper immediately after it's
first appearance in the world.<a name="FNanchor_1_290" id="FNanchor_1_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_290" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Europe</i> on fire; <i>France, Germany, Spain,</i> in flames,
which are extending to <i>Great Britain</i>. This desolation
continued and assisted by Mr. <i>Pitt</i>, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
figure of King <i>Henry</i> VIII. with bellows increasing
the mischief which others are striving to abate. He
is mounted on the stilts of the populace. A <i>Cheshire</i>
cheese depends from his neck, with 3000 <i>l.</i> on it.
This alludes to what he had said in Parliament&mdash;that
he would sooner live on a <i>Cheshire</i> cheese and a shoulder
of mutton, than submit to the enemies of <i>Great
Britain</i>. Lord <i>Bute</i>, attended by <i>English</i> soldiers,
sailors, and <i>Highlanders</i>, manages an engine for extinguishing
the flames, but is impeded by the Duke
of <i>Newcastle</i>, with a wheel-barrow full of <i>Monitors</i>
and <i>North Britons</i>, for the purpose of feeding the
blaze. The respectable body under Mr. <i>Pitt</i> are the
aldermen of <i>London</i>, worshiping the idol they had set
up; whilst the musical King of <i>Prussia</i>, who alone
is sure to gain by the war, is amusing himself with a
violin amongst his miserable countrywomen. The picture
of the <i>Indian</i> alludes to the advocates for retaining
our <i>West Indian</i> conquests, which, it was said,
would only increase excess and debauchery. The
breaking down of the <i>Newcastle</i>-arms, and the drawing
up the patriotic ones, refer to the resignation of
that noble Duke, and the appointment of his successor.
The <i>Dutchman</i> smoking his pipe, and a <i>Fox</i>
peeping out behind him, and waiting the issue; the
Waggon, with the treasures of the <i>Hermione</i>; the
unnecessary marching of the <i>Militia</i>, signified by the
<i>Norfolk</i> jig; the Dove with the olive-branch, and
the miseries of war; are all obvious, and perhaps
need no explication.</p>

<p>To those already given, however, may be added
the following doggrel verses:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Devouring flames with fury roll<br />
Their curling spires from Pole to Pole,<br />
Wide-spreading devastation dire,<br />
Three kingdoms ready to expire;<br />
Here realms convulsive pant for breath,<br />

A <i>Mill-stone</i> round his neck, which hung<br />
With bulk enormous to the ground,<br />
And adds thereto <i>Three Thousand Pound</i>;<br />
That none may dare to say henceforth,<br />
He wanted either weight or worth.<br />
He blows,&mdash;the flames triumphant rise,<br />

<p>The first impressions of this print may be known
by the following distinction. The smoke just over the
Dove is left white; and the whole of the composition
has a brilliancy and clearness not to be found in the
copies worked off after the plate was retouched.</p>

<p>I am told that <i>Hogarth</i> did not undertake this political
print merely <i>ex officio</i>, but through a hope
the salary of his appointment as Serjeant Painter
would be increased by such a show of zeal for the
reigning Ministry.</p>

<p>He left behind him a second part, on the same
subject; but hitherto it has been withheld from the
public. The finished Plate is in the possession of
Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p>There seems, however, no reason why this design
should be suppressed. The widow of our artist is
happily independent of a court; nor can aught relative
to the politics of the year 1762 be of consequence
to any party now existing. Our Monarch
also, as the patron of arts, would rather encourage
than prevent the publication of a work by <i>Hogarth</i>,
even though it should recall the disagreeable ideas of
faction triumphant, and a favourite in disgrace.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_290" id="Footnote_1_290"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_290"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The principal figure in the character of <i>Henry</i> VIII. appears
to be not Mr. <i>P.</i> but another person whose power is
signified by his bulk of carcase, treading on Mr. <i>P.</i> represented
by 3000 <i>l.</i> The bellows may signify his well-meaning, though
ineffectual, endeavours to extinguish the fire by wind, which,
though it will put out a small flame, will cherish a large one.
The guider of the engine-pipe, I should think, can only
mean his M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who unweariedly tries, by a more proper
method, to stop the flames of war, in which he is assisted by
all his good subjects, both by sea and land, notwithstanding
any interruption from <i>Auditors</i> or <i>Britons, Monitors</i> or <i>North
Britons</i>. The respectable body at the bottom can never mean
the magistrates of <i>London</i>; Mr. <i>H.</i> has more sense than to
abuse so respectable a body; much less can it mean the judges.
I think it may as likely be the Court of Session in <i>Scotland</i>,
either in the attitude of adoration, or with outspread arms
intending to catch their patron, should his stilts give way.
The <i>Frenchman</i> may very well sit at his ease among his miserable
countrywomen, as he is not unacquainted that <i>France</i>
has always gained by negociating what she lost in fighting.
The fine gentleman at the window with his garretteers, and
the barrow of periodical papers, refer to the present contending
parties of every denomination. The breaking of the
<i>Newcastle</i> arms alludes to the resignation of a great personage;
and the replacing of them, by the sign of the four clenched
fists, may be thought emblematical of the great œconomy of
his successor. The <i>Norfolk</i> jig signifies, in a lively manner,
the alacrity of all his Majesty's forces during the war; and
<i>G. T. [George Townshend] fecit</i>, is an opportune compliment
paid to Lord <i>Townshend</i>, who, in conjunction with Mr. <i>Windham</i>,
published "A Plan of Discipline for the Use of the
<i>Norfolk</i> Militia," 4to. and had been the greatest advocate
for the establishment of our present militia. The picture of
the <i>Indian</i> alive from <i>America</i> is a satire on our late uncivilized
behaviour to the three chiefs of the <i>Cherokee</i> nation, who
were lately in this kingdom; and the bags of money set this
in a still clearer point of view, signifying the sums gained by
shewing them at our public gardens. The sly <i>Dutchman</i>, with
his pipe, seems pleased with the combustion, from which he
thinks he shall be a gainer. And the Duke of <i>Nivernois</i>, under
the figure of a dove, is coming from <i>France</i> to give a cessation
of hostilities to <i>Europe</i>.</p><br /></div>

<p>4. <i>Henry Fielding</i>, ætatis 48. <i>W. Hogarth delin.
James Basire sculp.</i> From a drawing with a pen
made after the death of Mr. <i>Fielding</i>. "That gentleman,"
says Mr. <i>Murphy</i>, "had often promised
to sit to his friend <i>Hogarth</i>, for whose good qualities
and excellent genius he always entertained
so high an esteem, that he has left us in his writings
many beautiful memorials of his affection.
Unluckily, however, it so fell out that no picture
of him was ever drawn; but yet, as if it was intended
that some traces of his countenance should
be perpetuated, and that too by the very artist
whom our author preferred to all others, after
Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> had long laboured to try if he could
bring out any likeness of him from images existing
in his own fancy, and just as he was despairing
of success, for want of some rules to go
by in the dimensions and outlines of the face, Fortune
threw the grand <i>desideratum</i> in the way. A
lady, with a pair of scissars, had cut a profile,
which gave the distances and proportions of his
face sufficiently to restore his lost ideas of him.
Glad of an opportunity of paying his last tribute
to the memory of an author whom he admired,
Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> caught at this outline with pleasure,
and worked, with all the attachment of friendship,
till he finished that excellent drawing which
stands at the head of this work, and recalls to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
all, who have seen the original, a corresponding
image of the man." Notwithstanding this authentic
relation of Mr. <i>Murphy</i>, a different account of the
portrait has been lately given in one of the news-papers.
Mr. <i>Garrick</i>, it is there said, dressed himself
in a suit of his old friend's cloaths, and presented
himself to the painter in the attitude, and with the
features, of <i>Fielding</i>. Our <i>Roscius</i>, however, I can
assert, interfered no farther in this business than by
urging <i>Hogarth</i> to attempt the likeness, as a necessary
adjunct to the edition of <i>Fielding's</i> works. I am assured
that our artist began and finished the head in
the presence of his wife and another lady. He had
no assistance but from his own memory, which, on
such occasions, was remarkably tenacious.<a name="FNanchor_1_291" id="FNanchor_1_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_291" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_291" id="Footnote_1_291"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_291"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> To this sketch so great justice was done by the engraver,
that Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> declared he did not know his own drawing
from a proof of the plate before the ornaments were added.

<p>1. <i>John Wilkes</i>, Esq. <i>Drawn from the life, and
etched in aquafortis by Wm. Hogarth.</i> Price 1<i>s</i>. It
was published with the following oblique note. This
is "a direct contrast to a print of <span class="smcap">Simon Lord
Lovat</span>."<a name="FNanchor_1_292" id="FNanchor_1_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_292" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>, with his usual good humour, has been
heard to observe, that he is every day growing more
and more like his portrait by <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p>In the second impressions of this plate there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
a few slight variations, sufficient at least to shew that
the face of the person represented had been retouched.
I have been told, by a copper-plate printer, that near
4000 copies of this caricature were worked off on its
first publication. Being kept up for two or three
following nights on the occasion, he has reason to
remember it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_292" id="Footnote_1_292"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_292"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The original drawing, which was thrown by <i>Hogarth</i> into

<p>2. The Bruiser <i>C. Churchill</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_293" id="FNanchor_1_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_293" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in the character of a
<i>Russian Hercules</i>, &amp;c. The <i>Russian Hercules</i> was thus
explained, in <i>August</i>, 1763, by an admirer of <i>Hogarth</i>:
"The principal figure is a <i>Russian Bear</i> (i. e. Mr.
<i>Churchill</i>) with a club in his left paw, which he
hugs to his side, and which is intended to denote
his friendship to Mr. <i>Wilkes</i>: on the notches of the
club are wrote, <i>Lye</i> 1, <i>Lye</i> 2, &amp;c. signifying the
falsities in <i>The North Briton</i>: in his other paw is a
gallon pot of porter, of which (being very hot) he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
seems going to drink: round his neck is a clergyman's
band, which is torn, and seems intended to
denote the bruiser. The other figure is a <i>Pug-dog</i>,
which is supposed to mean Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> himself,
pissing with the greatest contempt on the epistle
wrote to him by <i>C. Churchill</i>. In the centre is a
prison begging-box, standing on a folio, the title
of which is, <i>Great George-Street. A list of the Subscribers
to the</i> North Briton: underneath is another
book, the title of which is, <i>A New Way to pay Old
Debts, a Comedy, by</i> Massinger. All of which allude
to Mr. <i>Wilkes's</i> debts, to be defrayed by the
subscriptions to <i>The North Briton</i>."</p>

<p>The same design is thus illustrated by a person
who thought somewhat differently of our artist:
"The <i>Bear</i>, with the shattered band, represents the
former strength and abilities of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>:
the full pot of beer likewise shews that he was in
a land of plenty. The stump of a headless tree
with the notches, and on them wrote <i>Lye</i>, Signifies
Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> former art, and the many productions
thereof, wherein he has excelled even Nature itself,
and which of course must be but lies, flattery, and
fallacy, the <i>Painter's Prerogative</i>; and the stump of
the tree only being left, shews that there can be no
more fruit expected from thence, but that it only
stands as a record of his former services. The
<i>Butcher's Dog</i> pissing upon Mr. <i>Churchill's</i> epistle,
alludes to the present state of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>; that
he is arrived at such an age to be reduced so low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
as, from the strength of a <i>Bear</i>, to a blind <i>Butcher's
Dog</i>, not able to distinguish, but pissing upon his best
friend; or, perhaps, giving the public a hint to read
that Epistle, where his case is more fully laid before
them. The next matter to be explained is the subscription-box,
and under it is a book said to contain
<i>a list of the Subscribers to the</i> North Briton, as well as
one of <i>a New Way to pay Old Debts</i>. Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>
mentioned <i>The North Briton</i>, to avoid the censure
of the rabble in the street, who, he knew, would
neither pity nor relieve him; and as Mr. <i>Churchill</i>
was reputed to be the writer of that paper, it
would seem to give a colour in their eyes of its
being intended against Mr. <i>Churchill</i>. Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>
meant only to shew his necessity, and that a book,
entitled <i>A List of the Subscribers to the</i> North Briton,
contained, in fact, a list of those who should contribute
to the support of Mr. <i>Hogarth</i> in old age.
By the book entitled <i>A New Way to pay Old Debts</i>,
he can only mean this, that when a man is become
disabled to get his livelihood, and much in debt,
the only shift he has left is, to go a-begging to
his creditors.</p>

<p>"There are likewise some of his old tools in this
print, without any hand to use them."</p>

<p>On the same occasion were published the following
verses, "on Mr. <i>Hogarth's</i> last delicate performance:"</p>

<blockquote><p>
"What Merit could from native Genius boast,<br />
To civilize the age, and please us most,<br />
In lasting images each scene to grace,<br />

Yet all the story finely to reveal,<br />
Was once the glory of our <i>Hogarth's</i> name;<br />
But see, the short-liv'd eminence of fame<br />

From which when once the unctuous juice is fled,<br />
A stinking vapour rises in its stead:<br />
So drops our Painter in his later day,<br />
His former virtue worn, alas! away,<br />
What busy dæmon, for thy cursed design'd,<br />
Could thus induce the rancour of thy mind<br />
To strike so boldly, with an impious hand,<br />
Against the blessings of thy native land?<br />

of the <i>Strollers</i>. This kind of <i>evacuation</i>, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
appears to have been regarded by <i>Hogarth</i> as a never-failing
<i>joke</i>. On the palette he exhibits the <i>North</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>

shoulder of the animal made rounder. Minute differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>

"Amongst the sons of men, how few are known<br />
Who dare be just to merit not their own!<br />
Superior virtue, and superior sense,<br />
To knaves and fools will always give offence;<br />
Nay, men of real worth can scarcely bear,<br />
So nice is Jealousy, a rival there.<br />
<br />
"Be wicked as thou wilt, do all that's base,<br />
Proclaim thyself the monster of thy race;<br />
Let Vice and Folly thy Black Soul divide,<br />
Be proud with meanness, and be mean with pride!<br />
Deaf to the voice of Faith and Honour, fall<br />
From side to side, yet be of none at all;<br />
Spurn all those charities, those sacred ties,<br />
Which Nature in her bounty, good as wise,<br />
To work our safety, and ensure her plan,<br />
Contriv'd to bind, and rivet man to man;<br />
Lift against Virtue Power's oppressive rod,<br />
Betray thy Country, and deny thy God;<br />
And, in one general comprehensive line,<br />
To group, which volumes scarcely could define,<br />
Whate'er of Sin and Dulness can be said.<br />
Join to a <i>F&mdash;&mdash;'s</i> heart a <i>D&mdash;&mdash;'s</i> head.<br />
Yet mayst thou pass unnotic'd in the throng,<br />
And, free from Envy, safely sneak along.<br />
The rigid Saint, by whom no mercy's shewn<br />
To Saints whose lives are better than his own,<br />
Shall spare thy crimes; and <span class="smcap">Wit</span>, who never once<br />
Forgave a Brother, shall forgive a Dunce."<br />

<p>
After this nervous introduction, our satirist proceeds:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"<span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>&mdash;I take thee, <span class="smcap">Candour</span>, at thy word,<br />
Accept thy proffer'd terms, and will be heard;<br />
Thee have I heard with virulence declaim,<br />
Nothing retain'd of Candour but the name;<br />
By thee have I been charg'd in angry strains<br />
With that mean falshood which my soul disdains&mdash;<br />
<span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>, stand forth&mdash;Nay hang not thus aloof&mdash;<br />
Now, <span class="smcap">Candour</span>, now Thou shalt receive such proof&mdash;<br />
Such damning proof, that henceforth Thou shalt fear<br />
To tax my wrath, and own my conduct clear&mdash;<br />
<span class="smcap">HOGARTH</span> stand forth&mdash;I dare thee to be tried<br />
In that great Court, where Conscience must preside;<br />
At that most solemn bar hold up thy hand;<br />
Think before whom, on what account you stand&mdash;-<br />
Speak, but consider well&mdash;from first to last<br />
Review thy life, weigh every action past&mdash;<br />
Nay, you shall have no reason to complain&mdash;<br />
Take longer time, and view them o'er again&mdash;<br />
Canst Thou remember from thy earliest youth,<br />
And as thy God must judge Thee, speak the truth,<br />
A single instance where, <i>Self</i> laid aside,<br />
And Justice taking place of fear and pride,<br />
Thou with an equal eye didst <span class="smcap">Genius</span> view,<br />
And give to Merit what was Merit's due?<br />
Genius and Merit are a sure offence,<br />
And thy soul sickens at the name of Sense.<br />
Is any one so foolish to succeed?<br />
On <span class="smcap">Envy's</span> altar he is doom'd to bleed.<br />
<span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>, a guilty pleasure in his eyes,<br />
The place of Executioner supplies.<br />
See how he glotes, enjoys the sacred feast,<br />
And proves himself by cruelty a priest.<br />
<br />
"Whilst the weak Artist, to thy whims a slave,<br />
Would bury all those powers which Nature gave,<br />
Would suffer blank concealment to obscure<br />
Those rays, thy Jealousy could not endure;<br />
To feed thy vanity would rust unknown,<br />
And to secure thy credit blast his own,<br />
In <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> he was sure to find a friend;<br />
He could not fear, and therefore might commend.<br />
But when his Spirit, rous'd by honest Shame,<br />
Shook off that Lethargy, and soar'd to Fame,<br />
When, with the pride of Man, resolv'd and strong,<br />
He scorn'd those fears which did his Honour wrong,<br />
And, on himself determin'd to rely,<br />
Brought forth his labours to the public eye,<br />
No Friend in Thee, could such a Rebel know;<br />
He had desert, and <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> was his foe.<br />
<br />
"Souls of a timorous cast, of petty name<br />
In <span class="smcap">Envy's</span> court, not yet quite dead to shame,<br />
May some Remorse, some qualms of Conscience feel,<br />
And suffer Honour to abate their Zeal:<br />
But the Man, truly and compleatly great,<br />
Allows no rule of action but his hate;<br />
Through every bar he bravely breaks his way,<br />
Passion his Principle, and Parts his prey.<br />
Mediums in Vice and Virtue speak a mind<br />
Within the pale of Temperance confin'd;<br />
The daring Spirit scorns her narrow schemes,<br />
And, good or bad, is always in extremes.<br />
<br />
"Man's practice duly weigh'd, through every age<br />
On the same plan hath <span class="smcap">Envy</span> form'd her rage.<br />
'Gainst those whom Fortune hath our rivals made<br />
In way of Science, and in way of Trade,<br />
Stung with mean Jealousy she arms her spite,<br />
First works, then views their ruin with delight.<br />
Our <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> here a grand improver shines,<br />
And nobly on the general plan refines;<br />
He like himself o'erleaps the servile bound;<br />
Worth is his mark, wherever Worth is found.<br />
Should Painters only his vast wrath suffice?<br />
Genius in every walk is Lawful Prize.<br />
'Tis a gross insult to his o'ergrown state:<br />
His love to merit is to feel his hate.<br />
<br />
"When <span class="smcap">Wilkes</span>, our Countryman, our common friend,<br />
Arose, his King, his Country to defend,<br />
When tools of power he bar'd to public view,<br />
And from their holes the sneaking cowards drew;<br />
When Rancour found it far beyond her reach<br />
To soil his honour, and his truth impeach,<br />
What could induce Thee, at a time and place,<br />
Where manly Foes had blush'd to shew their face,<br />
To make that effort, which must damn thy name,<br />
And sink Thee deep, deep in thy grave with shame?<br />
Did Virtue move Thee? no, 'twas Pride, rank Pride,<br />
And if thou hadst not done it, Thou hadst dy'd.<br />
<span class="smcap">Malice</span> (who, disappointed of her end,<br />
Whether to work the bane of Foe or Friend,<br />
Preys on herself, and, driven to the Stake,<br />
Gives Virtue that revenge she scorns to take)<br />
Had kill'd Thee, tottering on life's utmost verge,<br />
Had <span class="smcap">Wilkes</span> and <span class="smcap">Liberty</span> escap'd thy scourge.<br />
<br />
"When that <span class="smcap">Great Charter</span>, which our Fathers bought<br />
With their best blood, was into question brought;<br />
When, big with ruin, o'er each English head<br />
Vile Slavery hung suspended by a thread;<br />
When <span class="smcap">Liberty</span>, all trembling and aghast,<br />
Fear'd for the future, knowing what was past:<br />
When every breast was chill'd with deep despair,<br />
Till Reason pointed out that <span class="smcap">Pratt</span> was there;<br />
Lurking, most Ruffian-like, behind a screen,<br />
So plac'd all things to see, himself unseen,<br />
<span class="smcap">Virtue</span>, with due contempt, saw <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> stand,<br />
The murderous pencil in his palsied hand.<br />
What was the cause of Liberty to him,<br />
Or what was Honour? Let them sink or swim,<br />
So he may gratify, without controul,<br />
The mean resentments of his selfish soul.<br />
Let Freedom perish, if, to Freedom true,<br />
In the same ruin <span class="smcap">Wilkes</span> may perish too.<br />
<br />
"With all the symptoms of assur'd decay,<br />
With age and sickness pinch'd, and worn away,<br />
Pale quivering lips, lank cheeks, and faultering tongue,<br />
The spirits out of tune, the nerves unstrung,<br />
The body shrivel'd up, the dim eyes sunk<br />
Within their sockets deep, the weak hams shrunk<br />
The body's weight unable to sustain,<br />
The stream of life scarce trembling through the vein,<br />
More than half-kill'd by honest truths, which fell,<br />
Through thy own fault, from men who wish'd thee well;<br />
Canst thou, e'en thus, thy thoughts to vengeance give,<br />
And, dead to all things else, to Malice live?<br />
Hence, Dotard, to thy closet, shut thee in,<br />
By deep repentance wash away thy sin,<br />
From haunts of men to shame and sorrow fly,<br />
And, on the verge of death, learn how to die.<br />
<br />
"Vain exhortation! wash the Ethiop white,<br />
Discharge the leopard's spots, turn day to night,<br />
Controul the course of Nature, bid the deep<br />
Hush at thy Pygmy voice her waves to sleep,<br />
Perform things passing strange, yet own thy art<br />
Too weak to work a change in such a heart.<br />
<i>That</i> <span class="smcap">Envy</span>, which was woven in thy frame<br />
At first, will to the last remain the same.<br />
Reason may droop, may die; but Envy's rage<br />
Improves by time, and gathers strength from age,<br />
Some, and not few, vain triflers with the pen,<br />
Unread, unpractis'd in the ways of men,<br />
Tell us that <span class="smcap">Envy</span>, who with giant stride<br />
Stalks through the vale of life by Virtue's side,<br />
Retreats when she hath drawn her latest breath,<br />
And calmly hears her praises after death.<br />
To such observers <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> gives the lie;<br />
Worth may be hears'd, but Envy cannot die;<br />
Within the mansion of his gloomy breast,<br />
A mansion suited well to such a guest,<br />
Immortal, unimpair'd, she rears her head,<br />
And damns alike the living and the dead.<br />
<br />
"Oft have I known Thee, <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>, weak and vain,<br />
Thyself the idol of thy aukward strain,<br />
Through the dull measure of a summer's day,<br />
In phrase most vile, prate long, long hours away,<br />
Whilst Friends with Friends, all gaping sit, and gaze<br />
To hear a <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> babble <span class="smcap">Hogarth's</span> praise.<br />
But if athwart thee Interruption came,<br />
And mention'd with respect some Ancient's name,<br />
Some Ancient's name, who in the days of yore<br />
The crown of Art with greatest honour wore,<br />
How have I seen thy coward cheek turn pale,<br />
And blank confusion seize thy mangled tale!<br />
How hath thy Jealousy to madness grown,<br />
And deem'd his praise injurious to thy own!<br />
Then without mercy did thy wrath make way,<br />
And Arts and Artists all became thy prey;<br />
Then didst Thou trample on establish'd rules,<br />
And proudly level'd all the ancient schools;<br />
Condemn'd those works, with praise through ages grac'd,<br />
Which you had never seen, or could not taste.<br />
'But would mankind have true Perfection shewn,<br />
It must be found in labours of my own.<br />
I dare to challenge in one single piece,<br />
Th' united force of <span class="smcap">Italy</span> and <span class="smcap">Greece</span>.'<br />
Thy eager hand the curtain then undrew,<br />
And brought the boasted Master-piece to view.<br />
Spare thy remarks&mdash;say not a single word&mdash;<br />
The Picture seen, why is the Painter heard?<br />
Call not up Shame and Anger in our cheeks:<br />
Without a Comment <span class="smcap">Sigismunda</span> speaks.<br />
<br />
"Poor <span class="smcap">Sigismunda</span>! what a Fate is thine!<br />
<span class="smcap">Dryden</span>, the great High-Priest of all the Nine,<br />
Reviv'd thy name, gave what a Muse could give,<br />
And in his Numbers bade thy Memory live;<br />
Gave thee those soft sensations, which might move<br />
And warm the coldest Anchorite to Love;<br />
Gave thee that Virtue, which could curb desire,<br />
Refine and consecrate Love's headstrong fire;<br />
Gave thee those griefs, which made the Stoic feel,<br />
And call'd compassion forth from hearts of steel;<br />
Gave thee that firmness, which our Sex may shame,<br />
And make Man bow to Woman's juster claim,<br />
So that our tears, which from compassion flow,<br />
Seem to debase thy dignity of woe!<br />
But O, how much unlike! how fall'n! how chang'd!<br />
How much from Nature and herself estrang'd!<br />
How totally depriv'd of all the powers<br />
To shew her feelings, and awaken ours,<br />
Doth <span class="smcap">Sigismunda</span> now devoted stand,<br />
The helpless victim of a Dauber's hand!<br />
<br />
"But why, <i>my</i> <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span>, such a progress made,<br />
So rare a Pattern for the sign-post trade,<br />
In the full force and whirlwind of thy pride,<br />
Why was <i>Heroic</i> Painting laid aside?<br />
Why is It not resum'd? Thy Friends at Court,<br />
Men all in place and power, crave thy support;<br />
Be grateful then for once, and, through the field<br />
Of Politics, thy <i>Epic</i> Pencil wield;<br />
Maintain the cause, which they, good lack! avow,<br />
And would maintain too, but they know not how.<br />
<br />
"Through ev'ry <i>Pannel</i> let thy Virtue tell<br />
How <span class="smcap">Bute</span> prevail'd, how <span class="smcap">Pitt</span> and <span class="smcap">Temple</span> fell!<br />
How <span class="smcap">England's</span> sons (whom they conspir'd to bless<br />
Against our Will, with insolent success)<br />
Approve their fall, and with addresses run,<br />
How got, God knows, to hail the <span class="smcap">Scottish</span> Sun!<br />
Point out our fame in war, when Vengeance, hurl'd<br />
From the strong arm of Justice, shook the world;<br />
Thine, and thy Country's honour to increase,<br />
Point out the honours of succeeding Peace;<br />
Our <i>Moderation</i>, Christian-like, display,<br />
Shew, what we got, and what we gave away.<br />
In Colours, dull and heavy as the tale,<br />
Let a <i>State</i>-Chaos through the whole prevail.<br />
<br />
"But, of events regardless, whilst the Muse,<br />
Perhaps with too much heat, her theme pursues;<br />
Whilst her quick Spirits rouze at <span class="smcap">Freedom's</span> call,<br />
And every drop of blood is turn'd to gall,<br />
Whilst a dear Country, and an injur'd Friend,<br />
Urge my strong anger to the bitterest end,<br />
Whilst honest trophies to Revenge are rais'd,<br />
Let not One real Virtue pass unprais'd.<br />
Justice with equal course bids Satire flow,<br />
And loves the Virtue of her greatest foe.<br />
<br />
"O! that I here could that rare Virtue mean,<br />
Which scorns the rule of Envy, Pride and Spleen,<br />
Which springs not from the labour'd Works of Art,<br />
But hath its rise from Nature in the heart,<br />
Which in itself with happiness is crown'd,<br />
And spreads with joy the blessing all around!<br />
But truth forbids, and in these simple lays<br />
Contented with a different kind of Praise,<br />
Must <span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> stand; that Praise which <span class="smcap">Genius</span> gives;<br />
In Which to latest time the <i>Artist</i> lives,<br />
But not the <i>Man</i>; which, rightly understood,<br />
May make us great, but cannot make us good,<br />
That Praise be <span class="smcap">Hogarth's</span>; freely let him wear<br />
The Wreath which <span class="smcap">Genius</span> wove, and planted there.<br />
Foe as I am, should Envy tear it down,<br />
Myself would labour to replace the Crown.<br />
<br />
"In walks of Humour, in that cast of Style,<br />
Which, probing to the quick, yet makes us smile;<br />
In Comedy, his nat'ral road to fame,<br />
Nor let me call it by a meaner name,<br />
Where a beginning, middle, and an end,<br />
Are aptly join'd; where parts on parts depend,<br />
Each made for each, as bodies for their soul,<br />
So as to form one true and perfect whole,<br />
Where a plain Story to the eye is told,<br />
Which we conceive the moment we behold,<br />
<span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> unrival'd stands, and shall engage<br />
Unrival'd praise to the most distant age.<br />
<br />
"How could'st Thou then to shame perversely run,<br />
And tread that path which Nature bade Thee shun?<br />
Why did Ambition overleap her rules,<br />
And thy vast parts become the Sport of Fools?<br />
By different methods different Men excell,<br />
But where is He who can do all things well?<br />
Humour thy Province, for some monstrous crime<br />
Pride struck Thee with the frenzy of <i>Sublime</i>.<br />
But, when the work was finish'd, could thy mind<br />
So partial be, and to herself so blind,<br />
What with Contempt All view'd, to view with awe,<br />
Nor see those faults which every Blockhead saw?<br />
Blush, Thou vain Man, and if desire of Fame,<br />
Founded on real Art, thy thoughts inflame,<br />
To quick destruction <span class="smcap">Sigismunda</span> give,<br />
And let her memory die, that thine may live.<br />
<br />
"But should fond Candour, for her Mercy's sake,<br />
With pity view, and pardon this mistake;<br />
Or should Oblivion, to thy wish most kind,<br />
Wipe off that stain, nor leave one trace behind;<br />
Of <span class="smcap">Arts</span> <i>despis'd</i>, of <span class="smcap">Artists</span> by thy frown<br />
<i>Aw'd from just hopes</i>, of <i>rising worth kept down</i>,<br />
Of all thy meanness through this mortal race,<br />
Canst Thou the living memory erase?<br />
Or shall not Vengeance follow to the grave,<br />
And give back just that measure which You gave?<br />
With so much merit, and so much success,<br />
With so much power to curse, so much to bless,<br />
Would He have been Man's friend, instead of foe,<br />
<span class="smcap">Hogarth</span> had been a little God below.<br />
Why then, like savage Giants, fam'd of old,<br />
Of whom in Scripture Story we are told,<br />
Dost Thou in cruelty that strength employ,<br />
Which Nature meant to save, not to destroy?<br />
Why dost Thou, all in horrid pomp array'd,<br />
Sit grinning o'er the ruins Thou hast made?<br />
Most rank ill-nature must applaud thy art;<br />
But even Candour must condemn thy heart.<br />
<br />
"For Me, who, warm and zealous for my Friend,<br />
In spite of railing thousands, will commend,<br />
And, no less warm and zealous 'gainst my foes,<br />
Spite of commending thousands, will oppose,<br />
I dare thy worst, with scorn behold thy rage,<br />
But with an eye of Pity view thy Age;<br />
Thy feeble Age, in which, as in a glass,<br />
We see how men to dissolution pass.<br />
Thou <i>wretched Being</i>, whom, on Reason's plan,<br />
So chang'd, so lost, I cannot call a Man,<br />
What could persuade Thee, at this time of life,<br />
To launch afresh into the Sea of Strife?<br />
Better for Thee, scarce crawling on the earth,<br />
Almost as much a child as at thy birth,<br />
To have resign'd in peace thy parting breath,<br />
And sunk unnotic'd in the arms of Death.<br />
Why would thy grey, grey hairs, resentment brave,<br />
Thus to go down with sorrow to the grave?<br />
Now, by my Soul, it makes me blush to know<br />
My Spirits could descend to such a foe.<br />
Whatever cause the vengeance might provoke,<br />
It seems rank Cowardice to give the stroke.<br />
<br />
"Sure 'tis a curse which angry Fates impose,<br />
To fortify man's arrogance, that those,<br />
Who're fashion'd of some better sort of clay,<br />
Much sooner than the common herd decay.<br />
What bitter pangs must humbled <span class="smcap">Genius</span> feel!<br />
In their last hours, to view a <span class="smcap">Swift</span> and <span class="smcap">Steele</span>!<br />
How much ill-boding horrors fill her breast<br />
When She beholds Men, mark'd above the rest<br />
For qualities most dear, plung'd from that height,<br />
And sunk, deep sunk, in second Childhood's night!<br />
Are Men, indeed, such things, and are the best<br />
More subject to this evil than the rest,<br />
To drivel out whole years of Ideot Breath,<br />
And sit the Monuments of living Death?<br />
O, galling circumstance to human pride!<br />
Abasing Thought, but not to be denied!<br />
With curious Art the Brain, too finely wrought;<br />
Preys on herself, and is destroy'd by Thought.<br />
Constant Attention wears the active mind,<br />
Blots out her powers, and leaves a blank behind.<br />
But let not Youth, to insolence allied,<br />
In heat of blood, in full career of pride,<br />
Possess'd of <span class="smcap">Genius</span>, with unhallow'd rage,<br />
Mock the infirmities of reverend age.<br />

<p><a name="Footnote_2_299" id="Footnote_2_299"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_299"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A few months before this ingenious artist was seized
with the malady which deprived society of one of its greatest
ornaments, he proposed to his matchless pencil the work he
has intituled a <i>tail-piece</i>; the first idea of which is said to have
been started in company, while the convivial glass was circulating
round his own table. "My next undertaking," says
<i>Hogarth</i>, "shall be the <i>End of all Things</i>." "If that is the
case," replied one of his friends, "your <i>business will be finished</i>;
for there will be <i>an end of the painter</i>." "There
<i>will</i> so," answered <i>Hogarth</i>, sighing heavily; "and, therefore,
the sooner my <i>work is done</i>, the better." Accordingly
he began the next day, and continued his design with a diligence
which seemed to indicate an apprehension (as the report
goes) that he should not live till he had completed it. This,
however, he did in the most ingenious manner, by grouping
every thing which could denote the <i>end of all things</i>&mdash;a broken
bottle&mdash;an old broom worn to the stump&mdash;the butt-end of an
old musket&mdash;a cracked bell&mdash;bow unstrung&mdash;a crown tumbled
in pieces&mdash;towers in ruins&mdash;the <i>sign-post</i> of a tavern, called <i>The
World's End</i>, tumbling&mdash;the moon in her wane&mdash;the map of
the globe burning&mdash;a gibbet falling, the body gone, and the
chain which held it dropping down&mdash;<i>Phœbus</i> and his horses
dead in the clouds&mdash;a vessel wrecked&mdash;Time, with his hour-glass
and scythe broken; a tobacco-pipe in his mouth, the last
whiff of smoke going out&mdash;a play-book opened, with <i>Exeunt
omnes</i> stamped in the corner&mdash;an empty purse&mdash;and a statute of
bankruptcy taken out against Nature.&mdash;"So far, so good,"
cried <i>Hogarth</i>; "nothing remains but this,"&mdash;taking his
pencil in a sort of prophetic fury, and dashing off the similitude
of a <i>painter's pallet broken</i>&mdash;"<i>Finis</i>," exclaimed <i>Hogarth</i>,
"<i>the deed is done&mdash;all is over.</i>"&mdash;It is remarkable, that he died
in about a month after this tail-piece. It is also well known
he never again took the pencil in hand.</p><br /></div>

more absolute burlesque of this noble subject, than
<i>Hogarth</i>, who went seriously to work on it, has here
produced. "How art thou fallen, O <i>Lucifer</i>, thou
son of the Morning!" will be the exclamation of
every observer, on seeing this unaccountable performance,
in which <i>Satan</i> and <i>Death</i> have lost their
terrors, and <i>Sin</i> herself is divested of all the powers
of temptation.</p>

<h4>1772.</h4>


<p>1. The Good Samaritan; by <i>Ravenet</i> and <i>Delatre</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>The Grub-Street Journal</i> for <i>July</i> 14, 1737, appeared
the following paragraph: "Yesterday the scaffolding
was taken down from before the picture
of <i>The Good Samaritan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_301" id="FNanchor_1_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_301" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> painted by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>,
on the Stair Case in <i>St. Bartholomew's</i> Hospital,
which is esteemed a very curious piece." <i>Hogarth</i>
paid his friend <i>Lambert</i> for painting the landscape in
this picture, and afterwards cleaned the whole at his
own expence. To the imaginary merits of his coadjutor,
the Analysis, p. 26, bears the following testimony:
"The sky always gradates one way or other,
and the rising or setting sun exhibits it in great
perfection; the imitating of which was <i>Claud de
Lorain's</i> peculiar excellence, and is now Mr. <i>Lambert's</i>."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_301" id="Footnote_1_301"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_301"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Of this picture Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i> has a sketch in oil.</p><br /></div>


<p>2. <i>The Pool of Bethesda</i>; large, by <i>Ravenet</i> and
<i>Picot</i>. A small one, by <i>Ravenet</i>, has been mentioned
under 1748. Both very indifferent. Mr. <i>Walpole</i>
justly observes, that "the burlesque turn of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
artist's mind mixed itself with his most serious
compositions; and that, in <i>The Pool of Bethesda</i>, a
servant of a rich ulcerated lady, beats back a
poor man [perhaps woman] who sought the same
celestial remedy." To this remark I may add,
that the figure of the priest, in <i>The Good Samaritan</i>,
is supremely comic, and rather resembles some purse-proud
burgomaster, than the character it was designed
to represent.</p>

<p>On the top of the staircase at St. <i>Bartholomew's</i>
Hospital, and just under the cornice, is the following
inscription, "The historical paintings of this staircase
were painted and given by Mr. <i>William Hogarth</i>,
and the ornamental paintings at his expence, A. D.
1736." Both pictures, which appear of an oblong
square in the engravings, in the originals are surrounded
with scroll-work which cuts off the corners
of them, &amp;c. All these ornaments, together with
compartments carved at the bottom, were the work
of Mr. <i>Richards</i>. Mr. <i>Boydell</i> had the latter engraved
on separate plates, appended to those above them, on
which sufficient space had not been left.&mdash;<i>Hogarth</i> requested
that these pictures might never be varnished.
They appear therefore to disadvantage, the decorations
about them having, within these few years past,
been highly glazed. <i>The Pool of Bethesda</i> has suffered
much from the sun; and <i>The Good Samaritan</i>,
when lately cleaned, was pressed so hard against the
straining frame, that several creases have been made
in the canvas.</p>

<p>4. North and South of <i>Great Britain. W. Hogarth

sign-post; no sign on it; with <i>Edenborough</i> castle in
the back ground:&mdash;and an <i>Englishman</i> reposing on a
post, with a pot of <i>London</i> porter in his hand; the
sign of an Ox, with <i>roast and boild</i>, by way of inscription,
over his head; and a view of St. <i>Paul's</i> at
a distance. I do not believe it was designed by our
artist, whose satire was usually of a more exalted
kind: neither are the figures at all in his manner.</p>

<p>A sketch imputed to <i>Hogarth</i>, and engraved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
this matchless <i>Italian</i>, however, carries a double
temptation with it, as it unites with the works of
both artists, which are so much the present objects of
pursuit. No man can entertain too high an idea of
<i>Barlolozzi's</i> talents; but yet, being sometimes apt
to sacrifice similitude to grace,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Emollit mores, nec finit esset feros.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>He therefore is the last person from whom justice to
the strong marked characters of <i>Hogarth</i> could be
expected.</p>

<p>Since the above observations were communicated,
a new impression of this plate has appeared with the
name of <i>Sandby</i> annexed to it. The history of so
extraordinary a change deserves notoriety. The publisher
was at first assured that the sketch, from which
he designed the engraving, was not the production of
<i>Hogarth</i>. He, however, on his own judgement, pretended
to affirm the contrary, being at least convinced
that, during the late rage for collecting the works
of our artist, no name was so likely as his to draw
in purchasers. Having disposed of as many copies
as he could in consequence of hanging out such false
colours, he now sets sail again under those of <i>Sandby</i>,
and would probably make a third voyage with Mr.
<i>Bunbury's</i> flag at his mast head, were not our second
<i>Hogarth</i> at hand, to detect the imposture.&mdash;The price
of this etching, originally 2 <i>s.</i> 6 <i>d.</i> is now sold at 1 <i>s.</i>
though the proprietor has incurred the fresh expence
of decorating it in <i>aqua tinta</i>. Should it henceforward
fail to meet with buyers, I shall not be ready
to exclaim, with <i>Ovid</i>,</p>

The family of <i>Hogarth</i> affect to know nothing of this
painting; and say, if there is such a thing, it was
only slightly touched over by him. It must be confessed
that it bears little, if any, resemblance to the
representations of our artist edited by himself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>

<h4>1782.</h4>

<p>1. The Staymaker.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>2. Debates on Palmistry.</p>

<p>The humour in the first of the two preceding
prints is not very strong, and in the second it is scarce
intelligible. The Male <i>Staymaker</i> seems to be taking
professional liberties with a female in the very room
where her husband sits, who is playing with one of
his children presented to him by a nurse, perhaps
with a view to call off his attention from what is going
forward. The hag shews her pretended love for
the infant, by kissing its posteriors. A maid-servant
holds a looking-glass for the lady, and peeps significantly
at the operator from behind it. A boy with a
cockade on, and a little sword by his side, appears
to observe the familiarities already mentioned, and is
strutting up fiercely towards the Staymaker, while a
girl is spilling some liquor in his hat.</p>

<p>The figures employed in the study of <i>Palmistry</i>
seem to be designed for Physicians and Surgeons of
an Hospital, who are debating on the most commodious
method of receiving a fee, unattentive to the
complaints of a lame female who solicits assistance.
A spectre, resembling the <i>Royal Dane</i>, comes out behind,
perhaps to intimate that physick and poison
will occasionally produce similar effects. A glass
case, containing skeletons, is open; a crocodile hangs
overhead; and an owl, emblematic of this sapient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
consistory, is perched on an high stand. I suspect
these two to have been discarded sketches&mdash;the first
of them too barren in its subject to deserve finishing,
and the second a repented effort of hasty spleen
against the officers of <i>St. Bartholomew's</i>, who might
not have treated some recommendation of a patient
from our artist with all the respect and attention to
which he thought it was entitled. But this is mere
supposition.<br />

<p>The above four articles are all etched by <i>S. Haynes</i>,
pupil to the late Mr. <i>Mortimer</i>, from original drawings
in the possession of Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>The six prints which follow, were published by
subscription by Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i> in <i>April</i> 1782; of these
No. 5. was engraved by <i>Bartolozzi</i>, and the rest by
<i>R. Livesay</i>.<br />

<p>5. The Shrimp Girl, a head, from an original
sketch in oil, in the possession of Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>.</p>

<p>This plate, which is executed in the dotted manner
so much at present in fashion, should have been etched
or engraved like those excellent performances by
<i>Bartolozzi</i> after the drawings of <i>Guercino</i>. Spirit,
rather than delicacy, is the characteristic of our artist's
<i>Shrimp Girl</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>6. 7. Portraits of <i>Gabriel Hunt</i> and <i>Benjamin Read</i>, in
<i>aqua tinta</i>, from the original drawings in the possession
of the late Mr. <i>Forrest</i>. The drawing of Mr. <i>Hunt</i> was
taken in 1733, a period when, from the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
street-robberies, it was usual to go armed. <i>Hunt's</i>
couteau is stuck in one of his button-holes.</p>

<p>The figure of <i>Ben Read</i> was taken in 1757. Coming
one night to the club after having taken a long journey,
he fell asleep there. <i>Hogarth</i> had got on his roquelaure,
and was about to leave the room; but, struck
with the drollery of his friend's appearance, he exclaimed,
"Heavens! what a character!" and, calling
for pen and ink, took the drawing immediately,
without sitting down.</p>

<p>To be recorded only as votaries of the bottle and
pipe, is no very flattering mark of distinction to these
members of our artist's club. There is scarce a
meaner avenue to the Temple of Fame.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>8. Three plates, from the original sketches of
<i>Hogarth</i>, designed for the epitaph and monument of
<i>George Taylor</i>. The drawings are the property of
Mr. <i>Morrison</i>.</p>

<p><i>George Taylor</i> was a famous boxer, who died <i>February</i>
21, 1750. A writer already quoted speaks of
him in these terms: "<i>George Taylor</i>, known by the
name of <i>George the Barber</i>, sprang up surprisingly.
He has beat all the chief boxers but <i>Broughton</i>.
He, I think, injudiciously fought him one of the
first, and was obliged very soon to give out.
Doubtless it was a wrong step in him to commence
a boxer by fighting the standing champion: for
<i>George</i> was not then twenty, and <i>Broughton</i> was in
the zenith of his age and art. Since that he has
greatly distinguished himself with others; but has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
never engaged <i>Broughton</i> more. He is a strong
able boxer, who, with a skill extraordinary, aided
by his knowledge of the small and back swords,
and a remarkable judgement in the cross-buttock
fall, may contest with any. But, please or displease,
I am resolved to be ingenuous in my characters.
Therefore I am of opinion, that he is not
overstocked with that necessary ingredient of a
boxer, called a <i>bottom</i>; and am apt to suspect that
blows of equal strength with his too much affect
him and disconcert his conduct." <i>Godfrey on the
Science of Defence</i>, p. 61.</p>

<p>On <i>Taylor's</i> tombstone in <i>Deptford</i> church-yard is
the following epitaph:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Farewell ye honours of my brow!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Victorious wreaths farewell!</span><br />
One trip from Death has laid me low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By whom such numbers fell.</span><br />
Yet bravely I'll dispute the prize,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor yield, though out of breath:</span><br />

<p>The idea, however, is all that can merit praise in
these rough outlines by <i>Hogarth</i>. Some graver critics,
indeed, may think our artist has treated the
most solemn of all events with too great a degree of
levity.<br />

<p>9. Nine prints of <i>Hogarth's</i> Tour from drawings
by <i>Hogarth</i>, &amp;c. accompanied with nine pages of letter
press. The frontispiece of this work (Mr. <i>Somebody</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
was designed by <i>Hogarth</i>, as emblematical of
their journey, <i>viz.</i> that it was a short Tour by land
and water, backwards and forwards, without head or
tail. The 9th is the tail-piece (Mr. <i>Nobody</i>) of the
same whimsical nature with the first; the whole being
intended as a burlesque on historical writers recording
a series of insignificant events intirely uninteresting
to the reader. "Some few copies of the Tour," says
Mr. <i>Walpole</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_303" id="FNanchor_1_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_303" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "were printed by Mr. <i>Nichols</i> in the
preceding year. It was a party of pleasure down
the river into <i>Kent</i>, undertaken by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>,
Mr. <i>Scott</i>, and three of their friends, in which
they intended to have more humour than they accomplished,
as is commonly the case in such meditated
attempts. The Tour was described in verse
by one of the company, and the drawings executed
by the painters, but with little merit, except
the views taken by Mr. <i>Scott</i>."</p>

<p>I have transcribed this paragraph lest the readers
of the truly valuable work whence it is taken should
imagine the Tour printed by <i>J. N.</i> in 1781, was the
same with that published by Mr. <i>Livesay</i> in 1782.
The former was the production of the ingenious Mr.
<i>Gostling</i> of <i>Canterbury</i>; the latter was written by one
of the company, and, with the omission of a single
glaring indelicacy, and many false spellings, has been
faithfully edited by Mr. <i>Livesay</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Prints</span> <i>of uncertain Date</i>.</h4>


<p>Before Mr. <i>Walpole's</i> enumeration of the following
shop-bills, coats of arms, &amp;c. made its appearance,
perhaps few of them were known to our collectors.
Concerning the genuineness of some of these unimportant
engravings, no doubt can be entertained;
but whence is it inferred that <i>all</i> of them were his
productions? Do we receive them merely on the
faith of Mr. <i>Pond</i>? or are they imputed to our artist
for any other reason, or on the strength of any other
testimony? I am assured, by a gentleman who possesses
the chief of them, and is well acquainted with
<i>Hogarth's</i> manner, that from mere external evidence
several of these could not have been authenticated.</p>

<p>It is natural, however, to suppose that most of
them (if <i>Hogarth's</i>) were the fruits of his apprenticeship.<a name="FNanchor_1_304" id="FNanchor_1_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_304" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
As such, therefore, they should be placed
at the beginning of every collection.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_304" id="Footnote_1_304"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_304"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Let it be remembered likewise, that being bound apprentice
to the single branch of engraving arms and cyphers, the
majority of his works, whether on base metal or silver, must
have been long since melted down. During the minority of
<i>Hogarth</i>, the forms in which plate was made, could contribute
little to its chance of preservation. Pot-bellied tankards, and
salvers scalloped like old-fashioned minced-pies, were the
highest efforts of that period.</p></div>

<br /></p>


<p>18. Two small for <i>Milton. W. Hogarth inv. &amp; sculp.</i></p>

<p>It is so singular, that only plates referring to the
first and third books of <i>Paradise Lost</i> should be discovered
with our artist's name subscribed to them,
that I almost suspect they were not executed for any
edition of that work, but rather for some oratorio
or operatical performance founded thereon, though
neither performed nor printed. An example of two
prints by <i>Hogarth</i> to a single dramatic piece, we have
already met with in <a href="#Page_170"><i>Perseus and Andromeda</i></a>.</p>

<p>If the first of the present designs was made for the
first book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, one might almost swear
that <i>Hogarth</i> had never read it, or he could not have
fallen into the strange absurdities and incoherences
that his engraving displays. We have on one side a
Dæmon exalted in a kind of pulpit, at the foot of
which another infernal spirit lies bound in chains,
while a cannon is pointed at his head. At a distance,
in the centre of an arcade adorned with statues,
is a throne with a personage seated on it. Over
his head are little beings supporting an emblem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
eternity. Stars, &amp;c. appear above them. Whether
this dignified character was designed for "a spirit
of health, or goblin damn'd," it would be difficult
from his figure and attributes to determine.
Perhaps several works of fancy might be named,
with which the present representation would as naturally
connect as with the first book of <i>Milton's</i>
Poem.</p>

<p>The following plate exhibits two celestial characters
of equal age. They sit aloft in the clouds,
and listen to a concert of angels playing on various
instruments, and, among the rest, on a clumsy organ.
A ray of light darts down on a distant orb, designed,
I suppose, for the new-created world, towards which
the figure of a little being, scarce bigger than a
bird, though meant for <i>Satan</i>, is seen directing its
flight.<a name="FNanchor_1_305" id="FNanchor_1_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_305" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p>A bookseller of common sagacity would have been
justified in rejecting these designs, if prepared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
<i>Milton</i>. Indeed, had I not been taught by Mr. <i>Walpole's</i>
catalogue that such was their destination, I
should not hastily have conjectured that the former
of them had the least reference to the Poet's <i>Pandæmonium</i>.
Let it be remembered, however, that these
must have been among the earliest of <i>Hogarth's</i> performances,
and, like his prints for <i>Don Quixote</i>, were
in all probability thrown aside, as unsuited to the
purpose for which they were engraved. I have been
told, indeed, that a couple of plates, by our artist,
to the comedy of <i>The Spanish Friar</i>, are still existing.<a name="FNanchor_2_307" id="FNanchor_2_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_307" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
If <i>Hogarth</i>, therefore, was once employed in preparing
cuts to the plays of <i>Dryden</i>, the designs already
mentioned might have been intended for two different
scenes in <i>The State of Innocence, or the Fall of Man</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_305" id="Footnote_1_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_305"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In justice, however, to one of these designs, I transcribe
part of a letter that appeared in <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i> for
<i>March</i> 1782.
</p>
<p>"<i>Twickenham, March</i> 12.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Mr. Urban</span>,
</p>
<p>
"Throughout Mr. <i>Nichols's</i> excellent but unequal account
of <i>Hogarth</i> and his works, there is no decision I am so much inclined
to controvert, as that respecting the first of the two
plates to <i>Milton</i>. Perhaps the critic had only seen some imperfect
copy of the <i>Pandæmonium</i>, or formed his idea of it on
the vague description of those who who had considered it with
less attention than it really deserves. In my opinion, our artist's
arrangement of the infernal senate affords a happy instance
of his power to exhibit scenes of picturesque sublimity.
The ample space within the arcade, containing myriads of
subordinate spirits; the vault above, illuminated by supernatural
fires; the magnificence and elevation of <i>Satan's</i> throne;
his superior stature, and the characteristic symbols over the
seats of his peers; are circumstances entitled to a more flattering
reception than they have met with. That this print
has likewise absurdities, I am ready to allow: yet a <i>Voltaire</i>
might ask whether most of them are not inseparable from its
subject. I wish, for the sake of those who acknowledge the
genius of <i>Hogarth</i> only in familiar combinations, that the plate
in question were less rare. Our connoisseurs in general might
then decide on its merits. The only known impression of it,
as well as of its companion, is in the collection of Mr. <i>Walpole</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_306" id="FNanchor_A_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_306" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
who once indulged me with a sight of them both.
</p>
<p>
"I am content, however, that the second of these plates
should be abandoned to the austerities of criticism. The architecture
in the skies is every way unsuitable to its place. The
characters of the Almighty and our Redeemer have little, if
any, discrimination of attributes or years. They appear swinging
on a festoon composed of tiny cherubs, clustered together
like a swarm of bees. The Father rests his arm on one of
these childish satellites; and the Son holds another by the
wing, like <i>Domitian</i> catching a fly. Beneath, is a concert of
angels, who perform on different instruments, and among
others (as Mr. <i>Nichols's</i> book expresses it) on a clumsy organ.
<i>Lucifer</i>, approaching the new-created world, appears but as
an insect, flying towards an apple. This part of <i>Hogarth's</i>
subject is beyond the compass of any design on a contracted
scale. <i>Satan</i> might be delineated in the act of alighting on a
promontory, a part of the earth; but when its complete orb
is exhibited on a slip of paper measuring about six inches by
four, the enterprizing fiend must be reduced to very insignificant
dimensions. Such a circumstance may therefore succeed
in a poet's comprehensive description, but will fail on any
plate designed for the ornament of a little volume.
</p>
<p>
"Let me add, that these two are the neatest and most finished
of all the engravings by <i>Hogarth</i>. The second might have
been mistaken for one of the smaller works of <i>Picart</i>. Perhaps
the high price demanded for the plates, was the reason why a
series of them was not continued through the other books of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>."</p>

<p>19. A coat of arms from a large silver tea table.
Under these arms are a shepherd and his flock, exactly
the same as those on the tankard, N° <a href="#Page_428_25">25</a>. A
shepherd and shepherdess also are the supporters.
This has been ascribed to <i>Hogarth</i>, but I suspect it
to be a copy, and am told indeed that it was engraved
by <i>Pelitreau</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>20. Impression from a coat of arms engraved on
a silver dish made by <i>Delemery</i>; purchased, at some
distance of time, by Sir <i>Gregory Page</i>, Bart. who
erased the original arms from the escutcheon, and
had his own put in. The dish was afterwards bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
at <i>Christie's</i> at a sale of Sir <i>Gregory's</i> plate; and when
25 impressions only had been taken from it, was cut
to pieces by <i>R. Morrison</i>, 1781. I wish some of
these discoveries of <i>Hogarth's</i> engravings had been
made by people who had no immediate view to their
own profit, and the sale of their acquisitions. Too
many of our collectors are become dealers.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>21. Small oval print for the Rape of the Lock.
This was not designed for any edition of it. A few
impressions only were taken off from the lid of a
snuff-box engraved by Mr. <i>Hogarth</i>, as it is believed,
for some gentleman characterized by <i>Pope</i> in his
celebrated mock-heroic poem. It is one of the
poorest of <i>Hogarth's</i> performances.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>22. An emblematic print, representing Agriculture
and Arts. "<i>It seems to be a ticket for some society.</i>"<br />
<br /></p>


<p>23. A ticket for the benefit of <i>Milward</i> the tragedian.
A scene in <i>The Beggar's Opera</i>; "Pitt 3 <i>s.</i>"
inserted with a pen between "Theatre" and "Royal,"
in a scroll at the bottom of it. I have seen an impression
of it, under which is engraved, "<i>Lincolns-Inn
Fields, Tuesday, Aprill</i> 23. <i>A Bold Stroke for a
Wife</i>, with Entertainments, for the benefit of Mr.
<i>Milward</i>." This careless, but spirited little engraving,
has more of <i>Hogarth's</i> manner than several
other more laboured pieces, which of late have been
imputed to him.&mdash;Let the connoisseur judge.</p>

<p>This ticket (as is already observed) must have
been issued before 1733, when the Theatre in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
<i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</i> was shut up, and all the actors, <i>Milward</i>
among the rest, removed to <i>Covent Garden</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>24. The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light
by the <i>Gormagons</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
A. <i>Chin Quaw-Kypo'</i>         <i>Done from ye Original.</i><br />
1st <i>Emperor of China</i>.      <i>Painted at Pekin by Matt-chauter,</i><br />
B. <i>The sage Confucius.</i>     <i>Grav'd by Ho-ge</i><br />
C. <i>In Chin present</i>         <i>and sold by ye Printsellers</i><br />
<i>Oecumenical Volgi.</i>         <i>of London Paris and Rome.</i><br />
D. <i>The Mandarin Hangchi.</i>   <i>Hogarth inv. et sculp.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>To the earliest impressions of this plate, the name
of <i>Sayer</i> (for whom it has since been retouched) is
wanting. "<i>Stolen from</i> Coypel's Don Quixote."
Underneath, these verses:</p>

<blockquote><p>
From Eastern climes, transplanted to our coasts,<br />
Two oldest orders that creation boasts<br />
Here meet in miniature, expos'd to view<br />
That by their conduct men may judge their due.<br />
<br />

Appear distinguish'd with peculiar grace:<br />
What honour! wisdom! truth! and social love!<br />
Sure such an order had its birth, above.<br />
<br />
But mark Free Masons! what a farce is this?<br />
How wild their mystery! what a <i>Bum</i> they kiss!<a name="FNanchor_1_308" id="FNanchor_1_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_308" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />
Who would not laugh,<a name="FNanchor_2_309" id="FNanchor_2_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_309" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who such occasions had?<br />
Who should not weep, to think the world so mad?<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>I should suspect that this plate was published about
1742, when the Procession<a name="FNanchor_3_310" id="FNanchor_3_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_310" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of <i>Scald Miserables</i> had
been produced<a name="FNanchor_4_311" id="FNanchor_4_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_311" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to parody the cavalcade of the <i>Free</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
<i>Masons</i>, who ever afterwards discontinued their annual
procession. <i>Hogarth</i> was always ready to avail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
himself of any popular subject that afforded a scope
to ridicule. Among <i>Harry Carey's</i> Poems, however,
1729, third edition, is the following;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The Moderator between the Free-Masons and Gormogons.<br />
<br />
"The Masons and the Gormogons<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are laughing at one another,</span><br />
While all mankind are laughing at them;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then why do they make such a pother?</span><br />
<br />
"They bait their hook for simple gulls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And truth with bam they smother;</span><br />
But when they've taken in their culls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why then 'tis&mdash;Welcome Brother!"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The particular disputes between the parties referred
to by this poem, it is not easy to ascertain. Perhaps
the humourous writer alludes to some schism or

letters to Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, says, "I reckon next week to
hear you are a Free Mason, or a <i>Gormogon</i> at least."
4to edition, p. 188.</p>

<p>I learn from <i>Masonry Dissected</i>, &amp;c. a pamphlet
published in 1730, by <i>Samuel Prichard</i>, late member
of a Constituted Lodge, that "From the Accepted
Mason sprang the real Masons, and from
both sprang the <i>Gormogons</i>, whose grand master
the <i>Volgi</i> deduces his original from the <i>Chinese</i>,
whose writings, if to be credited, maintain the
hypotheses of the Pre-adamites, and consequently
must be more antique than Masonry."&mdash;This circumstance
will account for the <i>Chinese</i> names and
habits in our artist's plate.</p>

A different, but a smaller, print of this Mock Procession was
printed in <i>May</i> 1742, with the following memoranda, viz.
"The great Demand there has been for <i>The Westminster

"Though I do not belong to the Fraternity mentioned in

the annual disputes, I think it my duty, as a Watchman of
the city of <i>Westminster</i>, to preserve the memory of the late
extraordinary Cavalcade, the like to which hath never happened
since I have been in office. As more solemn processions
have of late years been very rare, it cannot surely
be taken amiss, either by the <i>Free Masons</i>, or the <i>Scald-Miserables</i>,
that I give so much distinction to this.

"<i>T. Touchit.</i>
</p>
<p>
"The Free Mason's Downfall, or the Restoration of the

After the print follows: "A Key, or Explanation of the

Extracts from <i>The London Daily Post, March</i> 20, 1740-1,
&amp;c. "Yesterday some mock Free-Masons marched through
<i>Pall-Mall</i> and <i>The Strand</i>, as far as <i>Temple-Bar</i>, in procession;
first went fellows on jack-asses, with cows horns in their
hands; then a kettle-drummer on a jack-ass, having two
butter-firkins for kettle-drums; then followed two carts
drawn by jack-asses, having in them the stewards with several
badges of their order; then came a mourning coach
drawn by six horses, each of a different colour and size, in
which were the grand master and wardens; the whole attended
by a vast mob. They stayed without <i>Temple Bar</i> till
the Masons came by, and paid their compliments to them,
who returned the same with an agreeable humour that possibly
disappointed the witty contriver of this mock scene,
whole misfortune is, that though he has some wit, his subjects
are generally so ill chosen, that he loses by it as many
friends as other people of more judgement gain."
</p>
<p>
Again, <i>April</i> 28, 1742. "Yesterday being the annual feast
of the ancient and honourable society of Free and Accepted
Masons, they made a grand procession from <i>Brook-street</i> to
<i>Haberdashers Hall</i>, where an elegant entertainment was provided
for them, and the evening was concluded with that
harmony and decency peculiar to the society."
</p>
<p>
"Some time before the society began their cavalcade, a
number of shoe-cleaners, chimney-sweepers, &amp;c. on foot
and in carts, with ridiculous pageants carried before them,
went in procession to <i>Temple-Bar</i>, by way of jest on the Free-Masons,
at the expence, as we hear, of one hundred pounds
sterling, which occasioned a great deal of diversion."
</p>
<p>
Again, <i>May</i> 3, 1744. "Yesterday several of the mock
masons were taken up by the constable empowered to impress
men for his Majesty's service, and confined till they
can be examined by the justices."</p><br /></div>

affixed to an impression of it belonging to the late
worthy Mr. <i>Ingham Foster</i>, whose prints were sold at

both from fancy and observation, were large, was
never, like the author of this plate, reduced to the
poor necessity of peopling his comic designs with

<i>W. Hogarth pinx. J. Sympson jun. sculp. Sold by J.
Sympson</i> engraver and print-seller, at <i>The Dove</i> in
<i>Russel-Court, Drury-Lane</i>. This Mr. <i>Walpole</i> observes
to be a very bad print. Perhaps he had only
seen some wretched impression, or copy of it (for
there are two, the one in a small size, the other
large, but fit for no other purpose than to adorn the
walls of a country Inn), and therefore spoke with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
contempt of a performance which hardly deserves so
unfavourable a character. This entire design, however,
is stolen from a picture of <i>Heemskirk</i>, which
has been since engraved in mezzotinto by <i>W. Dickinson</i>
of <i>New Bond-street</i>, and published <i>March 10</i>,
1772. The original picture is in the possession of
Mr. <i>Watson</i>, surgeon, in <i>Rathbone Place</i>.</p>

<p>The title given to this plate by the ingenious engraver,
is <i>The Village Magistrate</i>. All the male figures
are monkies; all the female ones, cats. <i>Hogarth</i> has
likewise been indebted to its companion&mdash;<i>The Constable
of the Night</i>. Few impressions from these plates
having been hitherto sold, they are both in excellent
condition, and the former of them exhibits an indisputable
instance of <i>Hogarth's</i> plagiarism.</p>

<p>While <i>Picart</i> was preparing his <i>Religious Ceremonies</i>,
he wrote to some friend here, to supply him
with representations illustrative of his subject. His
correspondent, either through ignorance or design,
furnished him with the two preceding plates by <i>Hogarth.
Picart</i> has engraved the former with a few
variations, and the latter with the utmost fidelity.
The one is called by him <i>Le Serment de la Fille qui
se trouve enceinte</i>; the other, <i>Le Baptême domestique</i>.
The first contains a supposed portrait of Sir <i>Thomas
de Veil</i>. For the conversion of a <i>civil</i> into a <i>religious</i>
ceremony, let the <i>Frenchman</i>, or his purveyor, be
answerable. The lines under <i>Hogarth's</i> performance
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Here Justice triumphs in his elbow chair,<br />
And makes his market of the trading fair;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>His office-shelves with parish laws are grac'd,<br />
But spelling-books, and guides between 'em placed<br />
Here pregnant madam screens the real fire,<br />
And falsely swears her bastard child for hire<br />
Upon a rich old letcher, who denies<br />
The fact, and vows the naughty Hussif lies;<br />
His wife enrag'd, exclaims against her spouse,<br />
And swears she'll be reveng'd upon his brows;<br />
The jade, the justice, and church ward'ns agree,<br />
And force him to provide security.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hogarth's</i> picture is in the possession of the Rev.
Mr. <i>Whalley</i>, at <i>Ecton, Northamptonshire</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Whalley</i> is the nephew of <i>John Palmer</i>, whose
portrait is mentioned among the works of <i>Hogarth</i>.
See p. <a href="#Page_295">295</a>. This picture too is at <i>Ecton</i>. The foregoing
print (as already observed, p. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>.) must have

<p>I have since met with an early impression of this
mezzotinto. The inscription, dedication, &amp;c. underneath
it, are as follows:</p>

<p>"<i>W. Hogarth pinx. Ford fecit.</i> The R<sup>t</sup>. Hon<sup>ble</sup>.
<i>Gustavus</i> Lord Visc<sup>t</sup>. <i>Boyne</i>, Baron of <i>Stackallen</i>,
one of his Majesty's most Hon<sup>ble</sup>. Priuy Council,

is humbly dedicated by his Lordship's most obedient

<p>"Published and sold by <i>Mich. Ford</i>, Painter and
Print-seller on <i>Cork Hill</i>. Price 5<sup>s</sup>. 5.<sup>d</sup>. [i. e. five
thirteens."]</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole's</i> is probably a later or a retouched
impression from the same plate, after it had fallen
into the hands of one <i>Andrew Miller</i>, who effaced the
name of <i>Ford</i>, and substituted his own.</p>

<p>This scarce print will undoubtedly suffer from comparison
with the works of <i>Smith, M'Ardell, Earlom,
Jones,</i> &amp;c. and yet perhaps it is the best mezzotinto
that <i>Ireland</i> has hitherto produced. It must be confessed,
however, that <i>Hogarth's</i> whole-length figure
of Lord <i>Boyne</i> is equally void of grace, meaning, and
proportion; but these defects have no connection
with the labours of <i>Ford</i>, which would have appeared
to more advantage had they been exerted on a
better subject.<br />

<p>There is a second head of Mr. <i>Pine</i>, a mezzotinto;
both his hands leaning on a cane. Printed for <i>George
Pulley</i>, at <i>Rembrandt's Head</i>, the corner of <i>Bride-court,
Fleet-street</i>.</p>

<p>I have called this "a second head," but know
not which of the two was first published.</p>

<p>In the first edition of the present work I had
described this plate as an unfinished one, but have
since met with it in a perfect state.<br />

<p>When Lord <i>Carteret</i>, about the year 1737, was
seeking artists to design, &amp;c. plates for his <i>Spanish</i>
edition of this famous novel, published in 1738,
<i>Hogarth</i>, of course, was not overlooked. His performances,
however, gave so little satisfaction to his
noble employer, that they were paid for, and then
laid aside in favour of <i>Vandrebank's</i> drawings, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
engraved by <i>Vandergucht</i>. The plates remaining
in the hands of Mr. <i>Tonson</i>, his lordship's publisher,
at his death, were bought by Mr. <i>Dodsley</i>,
who, finding they exhibited no descriptions that
could render them welcome to the possessors of any
copy of <i>Don Quixote</i> whatever, had the titles of the
chapters, &amp;c. to which they belong, together with
references to the corresponding pages in <i>Jarvis's</i>
translation, engraved under each of them. The
subjects of them are, I. Funeral of <i>Chrysostom</i>, and
<i>Marcella</i> vindicating herself; vol. I. p. 71. II. The
Inn-keeper's wife and daughter taking care of the
Don after being beaten and bruised, p. 129. III. <i>Don

Quixote</i> home, p. 166. <i>Tonson</i> had several specimens
of plates, both in quarto and octavo sizes, executed
for editions of <i>Shakspeare</i>, but they shared the same
fate with the others prepared for <i>Don Quixote</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>38. An oval, with two figures representing <i>Hymen</i>
and <i>Cupid</i>. A view of a magnificent villa at a distance.
This print was intended as a ticket for <i>Sigismunda</i>,
which <i>Hogarth</i> proposed to be raffled for. It
is often marked with ink 2 <i>l.</i> 2 <i>s.</i> The number of
each ticket was to have been inserted on the scroll
hanging down from the knee of the principal figure.
Perhaps none of them were ever disposed of. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
plate, however, must have been engraved about
1762 or 3. Had I not seen many copies of it
marked by the hand of <i>Hogarth</i>, I should have supposed
it to have been only a ticket for a concert or
music-meeting.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>39. Four heads from the cartoons at <i>Hampton-Court</i>.
An etching.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole</i>, in his <i>Anecdotes of Painting</i>, &amp;c.
vol. IV. p. 22. speaking of Sir <i>James Thornhill's</i>
attention to these celebrated pictures, has the following
remark: "He made copious studies of the
heads, hands, and feet, and intended to publish
an exact account of the whole, for the use of
students: but his work never appeared."</p>

<p>As this plate was found among others engraved
by <i>Hogarth</i>, it might probably have been one of his
early performances. His widow has directed a few
impressions to be taken from it, and they are sold at
her house in <i>Leicester-square</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>40. A Scene in a Pantomime Entertainment lately
exhibited; designed by a Knight of <i>Malta</i>. A satire
on the Royal Incorporated Society of Artists of
<i>Great Britain</i>. No name.</p>

<p>This design is difficult to be explained, as it alludes
to some forgotten dissentions among the artists
before the Royal Academy was founded. Sir <i>William
Chambers, Kirby, Rooker</i> the Engraver and Harlequin,
<i>Liotard</i>, remarkable for having adopted the
<i>Turkish</i> dress, and others, are introduced in it. The
hat and head of <i>Hogarth</i> also appear on one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
necks of a Hydra. It is hardly credible, therefore,
that he should have rendered himself an object of
his own satire. A mere etched outline of the same
design, with additions, was afterwards published, and
is marked plate II. It is larger than the original
plate, and must be considered as a slight temporary
sketch, of which the author is uncertain.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>41. A Ticket-porter carrying a load of chamber-pots
to some place of public resort, from the entrance
of which three grenadiers are keeping off the
crowd. At the bottom is written.</p>

<p>"<i>Jack</i> in an Office, or <i>Peter Necessary</i>, with Choice
of Chamber-pots.</p>

<p>"A Ticket for the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Price 6 <i>d.</i>"</p>

<p>Of the following articles the 49th, and 53d, are
the undoubted productions of <i>Hogarth</i>. Some of
the rest may admit of dispute. Those marked * I
have not yet seen in any collection but that of Mr.
<i>S. Ireland</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>* 42. Arms of <i>George Lambart</i> [<i>Lambert</i>] the
painter, an intimate friend of our artist.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>* 43. Arms of <i>Gore</i>, engraved on a silver waiter.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>* 44. Arms of a Duke of <i>Kendal</i>. N. B. There
never was a <i>Duke</i> of <i>Kendal</i>, but an infant son of
<i>James</i> II. The arms mentioned are certainly those
of the Dutchess of <i>Kendal</i>. The male shield must
be a mistake.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>* 45. Arms of <i>Chudleigh</i>; motto "Aut vincam,
aut peribo." Done for Major <i>L'Emery</i>, whilst
<i>Hogarth</i> was apprentice.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p>46. The Great Seal of <i>England</i>, from a large silver
table. This was given to Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i> by a Mr.
<i>Bonneau</i>, who took off the impression before the
year 1740.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>47. Twenty-six figures, on two large sheets, engraved
for "A Compendium of Military Discipline,
as it is practised by the Honourable the Artillery
Company of the City of <i>London</i>, for the initiating
and instructing Officers of the Trained Bands of
the said City, &amp;c. Most humbly dedicated to his
Royal Highness <i>George</i> Prince of <i>Wales</i>, Captain
General of the Honourable the Artillery Company.
By <i>John Blackwell</i>, Adjutant and Clerk to
the said Company.</p>

<p>"<i>London</i>. Printed for the Author; and are to be
sold at his house in <i>Well-Court</i> in <i>Queen-Street</i>,
near <i>Cheapside</i>, 1726."<br />
<br /></p>


<p>48. <i>Farinelli, Cuzzoni,</i> and <i>Heydegger. Cuzzoni</i>
and <i>Farinelli</i> are singing a duet. The latter is in the
character of a prisoner, being chained by his little
finger. <i>Heydegger</i> sits behind, and is supposed to
utter the eight following lines, which are engraved
under the plate:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Thou tuneful scarecrow, and thou warbling bird,<br />
No shelter for your notes these lands afford.<br />
This town protects no more the singsong strain,<br />
Whilst Balls and Masquerades triumphant reign.<br />
Sooner than midnight revels ere should fail,<br />
And ore Ridottos Harmony prevail;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>The cap (a refuge once) my head shall grace,<br />
And save from ruin this harmonious face.<a name="FNanchor_1_320" id="FNanchor_1_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_320" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>I am told, however, that this plate was designed
by the last Countess of <i>Burlington</i>, and etched
by <i>Goupy</i>. I may add, that the figures in it,
though slightly done on the whole, consist of
more than a single stroke, being retouched and
heightened by the burin in several places. On
the contrary, <i>Hogarth's</i> plate, intituled <i>The Charmers
of the Age</i>, only offers an etched outline,
which at once afforded the extent of his design,
leaving no room for improvement. The former
print exhibits traces of perseverance and assiduity;
the latter is an effort of genius that completes its
purpose without elaboration.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_320" id="Footnote_1_320"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_320"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> He had once enlisted as a private soldier in the Guards,
for a protection. See p. <a href="#Page_152">152</a>.</p><br /></div>


<p>49. The Discovery. This scarce plate is acknowledged
as genuine by Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>. The subject is a
black woman in bed; her eyes archly turned on her
gallant just risen, who expresses his astonishment on
the entrance of three laughing friends, one of them
with a candle in his hand. Underneath the print is
this apposite motto:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Qui color albus erat nunc est contrarius albo</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>A similar circumstance occurs in <i>Fletcher's Monsieur
Thomas</i>, and in <i>Foote's Cozeners</i>.</p>

<p>I know not of any among our artist's works that
displays so little character. It must have been one
of his early performances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be observed that, being founded on a
private occurrence, this print was never designed for
general circulation. Mr. <i>Highmore</i> the manager of
<i>Drury-Lane</i>, who bought <i>Cibber's</i> share in the patent,
is the Hero of it. A few copies only were
distributed among <i>Hogarth's</i> particular friends, and
the gentlemen whose portraits it contains. At the
bottom of the plate there is no descriptive title. <i>The
Discovery</i> was that by which Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i> mentioned
it when she recollected the very laughable circumstance
here commemorated by her husband's pencil.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>* 50. The Cottage. An impression from a breeches-button,
the size of a crown-piece; a sketch made for
Mr. <i>Camfield</i>, a surgeon, on a subject that will not bear
explanation. There is a copy of this little plate by
Mr. <i>S. Ireland</i>.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>51. <i>Pug</i> the Painter. This has been usually
understood as a satire <i>on Hogarth</i>, rather than a design
<i>by</i> him. Mr. <i>Ireland</i> once told me it was etched
by <i>Dawes</i>, and that our artist gave a copy of it, as
his own design, to Mr. <i>Kirby</i>. But I am assured
with superior confidence by another gentleman, that
the true author of it is to be sought among those artists
whom <i>Hogarth</i> had provoked by his contemptuous
treatment of their works. If <i>Pug</i> was not designed
as his representative, why is the animal exhibited
in the act of painting the ridiculous figure of
the <i>Priest</i> in <i>The Good Samaritan</i>?<br />
<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>

<p>52. A Head in an oval, coarsely engraved, and
subscribed "<i>Samuel Butler</i> Author of <i>Hudibras</i>."
Several connoisseurs, beside Mr. <i>Thane</i> who possesses
the plate, conceive it to be an undoubted work
of <i>Hogarth</i>. For what purpose it was executed,
and why suppressed (for no one has hitherto met
with even a proof from it) it is vain to enquire.
I am silent on the subject, heartily wishing that
throughout this work I had had the opinions of more
friends to record, and had offered fewer sentiments
of my own.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>53. "A very rare hieroglyphic print; representing
Royalty, Episcopacy, and Law, composed of emblematic
attributes, and no human features or
limbs; with attendants of similar ingredients. Beneath
is this inscription. Some of the principal
inhabitants of the Moon, as they were discovered
by a telescope, brought to the greatest perfection
since the last eclipse; exactly engraved from the
objects, whereby the Curious may guess at their
Religion, Manners, &amp;c. Price Six-pence."</p>

<p>A kind of scaffold above the clouds is the theatre
of this representation. Monarchy, Episcopacy, and
Law, appear characteristically seated. Their faces
are&mdash;a Crown-piece&mdash;a <i>Jew's</i> Harp, and&mdash;a Mallet.
The monarch holds a globe and sceptre, with crescents
on the tops of them. Instead of a collar of
<i>esses</i>, he wears a string of bubbles; his side is ornamented
with a pointed star; and a circle, the emblem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
of perpetuity, is embroidered on the cloth under
his throne. Episcopacy is working at a pump
(a type I suppose of the Church) by the assistance of
a bell-rope. The Bible is fastened to the handle of
the pump, and out of the nose of it issues money
that falls into a chest discriminated by an armorial
escutcheon, containing a knife and fork, properly
emblazoned, with a mitre by way of crest. The
lid of the coffer leans against a pillar, that serves also
to support a triple pile of cushions. Over the top of
the pump (which is fashioned much like a steeple) is a
weathercock on a small pyramid supported by balls;
and below it, through a circular opening, a little bell
appears to ring. Under the sacerdotal robe, a cloven
foot peeps out. Law sustains a sword; and behind
him appears a dagger thrust through the bottom of
a sieve. The attendants on Monarchy are of various
materials. The bodies and legs of such as seem designed
for soldiers, are composed of circular fire-screens
resembling shields. The trunks of the courtiers
are large looking-glasses, the sconces with candles in
them serving for hands and arms. The face of the
chief of these is the reverse of a sixpence; and a key
significantly appended to his sash, at once denotes his
sex and office. Under the figure of law are a male and
female modishly drest. Her head is a tea-pot, her
neck a drinking-glass, and her body a fan half spread.
On the oval that forms the countenance of her paramour,
is a coat of arms with supporters. His right
honourable legs are fan-sticks, and he seems in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
act of courtship. How this couple are immediately
connected with Law, is not very clearly pointed out.
<i>Hogarth</i>, however, we may suppose, had planned
some explanation of his hieroglyphics, as the letters
<i>a, b, c, d, e, f, g,</i> are placed over some of them, and
beneath others.</p>

<p>From the form of the perukes exhibited in this
design, I should suppose it was made above forty
years ago. Other circumstances in it need no decyphering.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>* 54. The Master of the Vineyard. St. <i>Matthew</i>
chap. xxi. v. 28. "Son, go work to-day in my
Vineyard."<br />
<br /></p>


<p>* 55. The <i>London</i> Infirmary for charitably relieving
sick and diseased Manufacturers and Seamen in
the Merchants' service, their Wives and Children.
A blank certificate for Pupils in Surgery and Anatomy,
printed on a half sheet, folio.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>56. A ticket for the benefit of <i>Spiller</i> the player.
He died in the year 1729.</p>

<p>In the plate before us, which possesses no small
share of humour, poor <i>Spiller</i> is represented in a melancholy
posture. His finances are weighed against
his debts, and outweighed by them. His
taylor's bill appears to be of great length, and many
others for ale, gin, &amp;c. are on the ground near him.
A bailiff is clapping him on the shoulder&mdash;a prison is
in sight&mdash;ladies and gentlemen are taking tickets, &amp;c.
This very uncommon and beautiful little print is,
at present, found only in the collection of Mr. <i>Ireland</i>.<br />
<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>57. St. <i>Mary's Chapel</i>. Five at night. Several performers
playing on different instruments. <i>William
Hogarth inv. G. Vandergucht sculpt.</i></p>

<p>This was certainly an ornament at the top of a
ticket for a music-meeting. The name of <i>Hogarth</i> is
affixed to it, and the whole design <i>might</i> have been
his. I do not, however, believe it <i>was</i> so. A few
of the figures appear to have been collected
from his works by some other hand, rather than
grouped by his own. <i>Vandergucht</i> too was so thoroughly
a mannerist, and especially in small subjects,
that he was rarely faithful to the expressions
of countenance he undertook to trace on copper.
There is no humour, and indeed little merit of any
kind, in this performance. It has not hitherto been
met with on the entire piece of paper to which it
must originally have belonged.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>A print called <i>The Scotch Congregation</i>, by <i>Hogarth</i>,
is almost unique, on account of its extreme indecency.
One copy of it was in a collection of his
works belonging to Mr. <i>Alexander</i> of <i>Edinburgh</i>.
He is said to have had it from Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i>. A second
copy is reported to exist in the possession of another
gentleman. No more impressions of it are known.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A correspondent at <i>Dublin</i> informs me, that in
the collection of Dr. <i>Hopkins</i> of that city are the following
seven prints by <i>Hogarth</i>:<br />
<br /></p>

<p>1. <i>The History of Witchcraft</i>. Humbly dedicated
to the Wise. Allegorically modernized. Part the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
First. Published according to act of Parliament.
<i>Hogarth inv. et sculpt.</i></p>

<p>Half sheet print. At one end, Witches attending
the punishment of two human figures; at the other,
several at their different occupations.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>2. <i>The History of Witchcraft</i>. Part the Second.
Published according to act of Parliament. <i>Hogarth
inv. et sculpt.</i></p>

<p>Same size as the former. Witches dancing;
others at various amusements. These two prints
contain a great variety of distorted figures.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>3. <i>A Suit of Law fits me better than a Suit of Clothes</i>.
Invented and engraved by <i>W. H.</i> and published pursuant
to an Act of Parliament, 1740.</p>

<p>An upright half-sheet. A Man in embroidered
clothes, his hat under his arm. A scroll in his left
hand, inscribed, "I'll go to Law." Huntsmen,
dogs, and horses in the back ground. Four lines in
verse underneath.</p>

<p>Useful in all families. Invented and engraved by
<i>W. H.</i> and published pursuant to an Act of Parliament,
1740.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>4. The same man in a tattered garment in a wild
country; a staff in his right hand, and a scroll in his
left, inscribed, "To shew that I went to law, and
got the better." Four lines at the bottom.</p>

<p>These two may be classed among his indifferent
prints.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>5. <i>The Caledonian March and Embarkation. Hogarth
invent. London</i>, printed for <i>T. Baldwin</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of <i>Scotchmen</i> embarking in the <i>Caledonian</i>
Transport. Labels issuing from their mouths.</p>

<p><i>The Laird of the Posts, or the Bonnets exalted.</i>
Printed for <i>T. Baldwin, London. Hogarth inv.</i><br />
<br /></p>


<p>6. <i>A Scotch Nobleman and his Friends taking possession
of several posts, having kick'd down the former
Possessors</i>. Labels from their mouths too tedious to
copy. A Lion on the fore-ground, hood-winked by
a <i>Scotch</i> plaid.</p>

<p>Supposed to be printed for <i>The London Magazine</i>.<br />
<br /></p>


<p>7. <i>The Lion entranced</i>. Printed for <i>T. Baldwin,
London. Hogarth inv.</i> 1762.</p>

<p>A Lion in a Coffin. A plate on the cover, inscribed,
"Leo <i>Britanicus</i>, Ob. An. 1762. Requiescat
in pace." Attended by state mourners with labels
as above. In one corner <i>Hibernia</i> supplicating
for her Sister's interest.<br />
<br /></p>

<p>A respect for the obliging communicator has induced
me to publish this <i>supposed</i> addition to the foregoing
catalogue of <i>Hogarth's</i> works. But, without
ocular proof, I cannot receive as genuine any one
of the plates enumerated. The name of our Artist
has more than once been subscribed to the wretched
productions of others; and a collector at <i>Dublin</i>
must have had singular good fortune indeed, if he
has met with seven authentic curiosities unknown to
the most confidential friends of <i>Hogarth</i>, and the
most industrious connoisseurs about <i>London</i>. I may
add, that two, if not three, of the above-mentioned
anti-ministeral pieces, appeared in 1762, the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
year in which our artist was appointed <i>Serjeant Painter</i>.
Till that period he is unsuspected of having
engaged his pencil in the service of politicks; and
<i>T. Baldwin</i> (perhaps a fictitious name) is not known
to have been on any former occasion his publisher.
So much for the probability of <i>Hogarth's</i> having
ushered performances like these into the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Chance, and the kindness of my friends, have
not enabled me to form a more accurate series of
<i>Hogarth's</i> labours. Those of the collector, however,
are still incomplete, unless he can furnish himself
with a specimen of several other pieces, said, I think,
to have been produced a little before our artist's
marriage. I forbear to keep my readers in suspense
on the occasion. <i>Hogarth</i> once taking up some plain
ivory fishes that lay on his future wife's card-table,
observed how much was wanting to render them natural
representations. Having delivered this remark
with becoming gravity, he proceeded to engrave
scales, fins, &amp;c. on each of them. A few impressions
have been taken from these curiosities, which
remain in Mrs. <i>Hogarth's</i> possession. As a <i>button</i> decorated
by her husband has been received into the
foregoing catalogue of his works, it can hardly be
disgraced by this brief mention of the ornaments
he bestowed on a <i>counter</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are three large volumes in quarto by <i>Lavater</i>,
a minister at <i>Zurich</i> (with great numbers of
plates), on Physiognomy. Among these are two
containing several groups of figures from different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
prints of <i>Hogarth</i>, together with the portraits of Lord
<i>Lovat</i> and <i>Wilkes</i>. For what particular purpose they
are introduced, remains to me a secret.<a name="FNanchor_1_321" id="FNanchor_1_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_321" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In "An Address of Thanks to the Broad Bottoms,
for the good things they have done, and
the evil things they have not done, since their
elevation, 1745," is what the author calls "A
curious emblematic Frontispiece, taken from an
original painting of the ingenious Mr. <i>H&mdash;&mdash;th</i>;"
a palpable imposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole, Anecdotes of Painting</i>, Vol. IV. 63,
observes, that "<i>Hogarth</i> drew the supposed funeral of
<i>Vanaken</i>, attended by the painters he worked for,
discovering every mark of grief and despair." To
explain this passage, it should be added, that "he
was employed by several considerable artists here,
to draw the attitudes, and dress the figures in
their pictures."</p>

<p>The merits of <i>Hogarth</i>, as an engraver, are inconsiderable.
His hand was faithful to character, but
had little acquaintance with the powers of light and
shade. In some of his early prints he was an assiduous
imitator of <i>Callot</i>, but deviated at last into a
manner of his own, which suffers much by comparison
with that of his coadjutors, <i>Ravenet</i> and <i>Sullivan</i>.
In the pieces finished by these masters of
their art, there is a clearness that <i>Hogarth</i> could
never reach. His strokes sometimes look as if fortuitously
disposed, and sometimes confusedly thwart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
each other in almost every possible direction. What
he wanted in skill, he strove to make up in labour;
but the result of it was a universal haze and indistinctness,
that, by excluding force and transparency,
has rendered several of his larger plates less captivating
than they would have been, had he entrusted
the sole execution of them to either of the artists
already mentioned. His smaller etchings, indeed,
such as <i>The Laughing Pit</i>, &amp;c. cannot receive too
much commendation.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Walpole</i> has justly observed, that "many
wretched prints came out to ridicule" the <i>Analysis
of Beauty.</i> He might have added, that no small
number of the same quality were produced immediately
after the <i>Times</i> made its appearance. I wish
it had been in my power to have afforded my readers
a complete list of these performances, that as
little as possible might have been wanting to the
history of poor <i>Hogarth's</i> first and second persecution.
Such a catalogue, however, not being necessary to
the explanation of his works, it is with the less regret
omitted.<a name="FNanchor_2_322" id="FNanchor_2_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_322" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The scarceness of the good impressions of <i>Hogarth's</i>
larger works is in great measure owing to their having
been pasted on canvas or boards, to be framed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
and glazed for furniture. There were few people
who collected his prints for any other purpose at
their first appearance. The majority of these sets
being hung up in <i>London</i> houses, have been utterly
spoiled by smoke. Since foreigners have learned
the value of the same performances, they have also
been exported in considerable numbers. Wherever
a taste for the fine arts has prevailed, the works of
this great master are to be found. Messieurs <i>Torré</i>
have frequent commissions to send them into <i>Italy</i>.
I am credibly informed that the Empress of <i>Russia</i>
has expressed uncommon pleasure in examining such
genuine representations of <i>English</i> manners; and I have
seen a set of cups and saucers with <i>The Harlot's Progress</i>
painted on them in <i>China</i> about the year 1739.</p>

<p>Of all such engravings as are Mrs. <i>Hogarth's</i>
property, the later impressions continue selling on
terms specified many years ago in her printed catalogue,
which the reader will find at the end of this
pamphlet. The few elder proofs that remain undisposed
of, may be likewise had from her agent at
an advance of price. As to the plates which our
artist had not retained as his own property, when any
of these desiderata are found (perhaps in a state of
corrosion), they are immediately vamped up, and impressions
from them are offered to sale, at three, four,
or five times their original value. They are also
stained to give them the appearance of age; and on
these occasions we are confidently assured, that only
a few copies, which had lurked in some obscure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
warehouse, or neglected port-feuille, had been just
discovered. This information is usually accompanied
by sober advice to buy while we may, as the
vender has scarce a moment free from the repeated
solicitations of the nobility and gentry, whom he always
wishes to oblige, still affording that preference
to the connoisseur which he withholds from the less
enlightened purchaser. It is scarce needful to observe,
that no man ever visited the shops of these polite
dealers, without soon fancying himself entitled
to the more creditable of the aforesaid distinctions.
Thus becoming a dupe to his own vanity, as well as
to the artifice of the tradesman, he has speedily the
mortification to find his supposed rarities are to be
met with in every collection, and not long afterwards
on every stall. The caution may not prove useless
to those who are ambitious to assemble the works of
<i>Hogarth</i>. Such a pursuit needs no apology; for
sure, of all his fraternity, whether ancient or modern,
he bent the keenest eye on the follies and vices
of mankind, and expressed them with a degree of
variety and force, which it would be vain to seek
among the satiric compositions of any other painters.
In short, what is observed by <i>Hamlet</i> concerning a
player's office, may, with some few exceptions, be
applied to the designs of <i>Hogarth</i>. "Their end,
both at the first, and now, was, and is, to hold
as 'twere the mirror up to nature; to shew virtue
her own feature, scorn her own image, and the
very age and body of the time his own form and
pressure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span></p>

<p>I may add, that, since the appearance of Mr. <i>Walpole's</i>
Catalogue, a disposition to attribute several
anonymous plates, on ludicrous subjects, to <i>Hogarth</i>,
has betrayed itself in more than a single instance:<a name="FNanchor_3_323" id="FNanchor_3_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_323" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
a supposition has also prevailed that there was a time
when <i>Hogarth</i> had the whole field of satire to himself,
and we could boast of no designers whose performances
could be mistaken for his own. The latter
notion is undoubtedly true, if real judges are to decide;
and yet many prints, very slightly impregnated
with humour, continue to be ascribed to him.
It should therefore be observed, that, at the same period,
<i>Bickham, Vandergucht, Boitard, Gravelot, Laguerre</i>
the younger, &amp;c. were occasionally publishing
satirical Sketches, and engraving laughable frontispieces
for books and pamphlets. To many of these,
for various reasons, they forbore to set their names;
and we have at present collectors, who, to obtain the
credit of having made discoveries, are willing to
adopt such performances as the genuine effusions of
<i>Hogarth</i>, although every way beneath his talents, and
repugnant to his style of engraving. Perhaps also the
names of other painters and designers have been occasionally
obliterated, to countenance the same fallacy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
Copies likewise have been palmed on the unwary
for originals. "Therefore" (gentle reader) for once
be content to follow the advice of <i>Pistol</i>, "Go clear
thy chrystals, and <i>Caveto</i> be thy counsellor." For if
all such fatherless engravings, as the vanity of some,
and the interest, or the ignorance, of others, would
introduce among the works of our artist, were to be
admitted, when would the collector's labour and expence
be at end?</p>

<p>Among other anonymous plates ascribed to <i>Hogarth</i>,
but omitted in the present catalogue, is the following,
<i>A living Dog is better than a dead Lion</i>, or,
<i>The Vanity of human Glory; a design for the Monument
of General Wolfe</i>, 1760. A medallion of our hero
appears on the side of a pyramid. On the base of it
is the well known speech of <i>Shakespeare's Brutus</i>,</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Set Honour in one hand, and Death in t' other,<br />
And I will look on both indifferent:<br />
And let the Gods so speed me, as I love<br />
The name of Honour more than I fear Death</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>At the bottom a dying Lion is extended, while a
Dog (with <i>Minden</i> on his collar, and <i>Honour's a
jest</i>, &amp;c. issuing from his mouth) is at once lifting
up his leg against the noble brute, and treading on a
wreath of laurel. <i>Here lies Honour</i>, is also written
on the side of the expiring animal. I have since
been assured that this print was by another artist,
whose name I omit to mention, because perhaps he
would wish it, on the present occasion, suppressed.</p>

<h3><a name="POSTSCRIPT" id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT.</a></h3>


<p>The Author of this pamphlet, being convinced
that, in spite of all his care and attention, some
errors may still be found in his catalogue, list of variations,
&amp;c. will think himself highly obliged by
any gentlemen who will point them out, and enable
him to correct them. Such favours shall be gratefully
acknowledged, if the present rude Essay towards
an account of <i>Hogarth's</i> different performances
should happen to reach another edition.</p>

<p>As in consequence of the extraordinary prices
lately paid for the collected works of this great master,
certain dealers, &amp;c. are supposed to be assembling
as many of his prints as they can meet with,&mdash;binding
them up in pompous volumes,&mdash;writing "fine
old impressions" either over or under them&mdash;specifying
the precise sums pretended to have been disbursed
for several of them (perhaps a guinea for a
three shilling article)&mdash;preparing to offer a few rare
trifles to sale, overloaded with a heap of wretched
proofs from our artist's more capital performances;&mdash;exhibiting
imperfect suites of such as are cut out of
books; and intending to station puffers at future auctions,
whose office will be to intimate they have received
commissions to bid up as far as such or such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
an amount (i. e. the sum under which the concealed
proprietor resolves not to part with his ware), &amp;c. &amp;c.
it is hoped the reader will excuse a few parting
words of admonition. Perhaps it may be in the
power of Mrs. <i>Hogarth</i> to select a few sets from
such of her husband's pieces as have remained in her
own custody from the hour of their publication. Let
the multitude, who of course cannot be supplied
with these, become their own collectors. Even ignorance
is a more trusty guide than professional artifice.
It may be urged, indeed, that the proportionate
value of impressions<a name="FNanchor_1_324" id="FNanchor_1_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_324" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> can be ascertained only by
those who have examined many of them in their various
states, with diligence and acuteness. But surely
to qualify ourselves for estimating the merit of the
curiosities we are ambitious to purchase, is wiser
than to rely altogether on the information of people
whose interest is commonly the reverse of our own.
Let it also be remembered, that the least precious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
all <i>Hogarth's</i> productions are by far the scarcest; and
that when, at an immoderate expence, we have procured
impressions from tankards ornamented by him,
or armorial ensigns engraved for the books of his customers,
we shall be found at last to have added nothing
to his fame, or the entertaining quality of our
own collections. By such means, however, we may
open a door to imposition. A work like <i>The Harlot's
Progress</i> will certainly remain unimitated as well
as inimitable; but it is in the power of every bungler
to create fresh coats of arms, or shop bills with our
artist's name subscribed to them: and wherein will
the Lion or Griffin of <i>Hogarth</i> be discovered to excell
the same representation by a meaner hand? A
crafty selection of paper, and a slight attention to
chronology and choice of subjects, with the aid of
the hot-press, may, in the end, prove an overmatch
for the sagacity of the ablest connoisseur. A single
detection of such a forgery would at least give rise
to suspicions that might operate even where no fallacy
had been designed. How many fraudulent imitations
of the smaller works of <i>Rembrandt</i> are known
to have been circulated with success!&mdash;But it may
be asked, perhaps, from what source the author of
this pamphlet derives his knowledge of such transactions.
His answer is, from the majority of collectors
whom he has talked with in consequence of
his present undertaking.</p>

<p>He ought not, however, to conclude without observing,
that several <i>genuine</i> works of <i>Hogarth</i> yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
remain to be engraved. He is happy also to add
that a young artist, every way qualified for such a
task, has already published a few of these by subscription.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_324" id="Footnote_1_324"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_324"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Prints have, of late years, been judiciously rated according
to the quality of their <i>impressions</i>. But the very term <i>impression</i>,
as applied to copper-plates, perhaps is a novelty among
us. If we refer to the earliest and most valuable assemblage of
portraits (such as that catalogued by <i>Ames</i>, afterwards purchased
by Dr. <i>Fothergill</i>, and lately sold to Mr. <i>Thane</i>), we
shall have little reason to suppose any regard was once paid to
a particular of so much importance. As fast as heads were
met with, they were indiscriminately received; and the faintest
proofs do not appear to have been excluded at a time when
the strongest might easily have been procured. In consequence
of an <i>àmás</i> so carelessly formed, the volumes already mentioned,
were found to display alternately the most beautiful and the
most defective specimens of the graphic art.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>J. N.</i> had once thoughts of adding a list of the
copies made from the works <i>of Hogarth</i>; but finding
them to be numerous, beyond expectation, has desisted
from a task he could not easily accomplish.
This pursuit, however, has enabled him to suggest
yet another caution to his readers. Some of the early
invaders of <i>Hogarth's</i> property were less audacious
than the rest; and, forbearing to make exact imitations
of his plates, were content with only borrowing
particular circumstances from each of them, which
they worked up into a similar fable. A set of <i>The
Rake's Progress</i>, in which the figures were thus disguised
and differently grouped, has been lately found.
But since the rage of collection broke out with its
present vehemence, those dealers who have met
with any such diversified copies, have been desirous
of putting them off either as the first thoughts of
<i>Hogarth</i>, or as the inferior productions of elder artists
on whose designs he had improved. There, is
also a very small set of <i>The Rake's Progress</i>, contrived
and executed with the varieties already mentioned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
and even this has been offered to sale under the former
of these descriptions. Thus, as <i>Shakspeare</i> says,
<i>While we shut the gate upon one</i> imposition, <i>another
knocks at the door</i>.</p>

<p>It may not be impertinent to conclude these cautions
with another notice for the benefit of unexperienced
collectors, who in their choice of prints usually
prefer the blackest. The earliest copies of <i>Hogarth's</i>
works are often fainter than such as have been
retouched. The excellence of the former consists
in clearness as well as strength; but strength only is
the characteristic of the latter. The first and third
copies of <i>The Harlot's Progress</i> will abundantly illustrate
my remark, which, however, is confined to good
impressions of the plates in either state; for some
are now to be met with that no more possess the recommendation
of transparency than that of force. I
may add, that when plates are much worn, it is customary
to load them with a double quantity of colour,
that their weakness, as far as possible, may escape
the eye of the purchaser. This practice the
copper-plate printers facetiously entitle&mdash;<i>coaxing</i>;
and, by the aid of it, the deeper strokes of the graver
which are not wholly obliterated, become clogged
with ink, while every finer trace, which was of a nature
less permanent, is no longer visible. Thus in
the modern proofs of <i>Garrick</i> in <i>King Richard III.</i>
the armour, tent, and habit, continue to have considerable
strength, though the delicate markings in
the face, and the shadows on the inside of the hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
have long since disappeared. Yet this print, even in
its faintest state, is still preferable to such smutty impositions
as have been recently described. The modern
impressions of <i>The Fair</i>, and <i>The March to Finchley</i>,
will yet more forcibly illustrate the same remark.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the original paintings of <i>Hogarth</i> already enumerated
may be added a Breakfast-piece, preserved
in <i>Hill-Street, Berkeley-Square</i>, in the possession of
<i>William Strode</i>, Esq; of <i>Northaw, Herts</i>. It contains
portraits of his father the late <i>William Strode</i>, Esq;
his mother Lady <i>Anne</i> (who was sister to the late
Earl of <i>Salisbury</i>), Colonel <i>Strode</i>, and Dr. <i>Arthur
Smith</i> (afterwards Archbishop of <i>Dublin</i>).</p>

<p>The following letter, printed in <i>The Public Advertiser</i>
soon after the first edition of the present
work made its appearance, may possibly contain
some authentic particulars of the early life of the
famous Monsieur <i>St. André</i>. Mr. <i>Woodfall's</i> ingenious
correspondent does not, however, dispose me
to retract a syllable of what is advanced in the text;
for he fails throughout in his attempts to exculpate
our hero from any one of the charges alledged against
him. On the contrary, he confirms, with additions,
a considerable part of them, and strives only to
evade or overwhelm the rest by studied amplifications
of the little good which industrious partiality could
pick out of its favourite character. I shall now subjoin
his epistle, with a few unconnected remarks appended
to it. A rambling performance must apologize
for a desultory refutation.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"The entertaining author of the last biography
of the admirable <i>Hogarth</i>, in the excess of
commendation of a particular risible subject for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
his pencil, has written too disadvantageously of
the late Mr. <i>St. André</i>. One who knew him intimately
(but was never under the smallest obligation
to him) for the last twenty years of his life,
and has learned the tradition of his earlier conduct
seemingly better than the editor of the article
in question, takes the liberty to give a more
favourable idea of him, and without intending to
enter into a controversy with this agreeable Collector
of Anecdotes, to vindicate this <i>notorious
man</i>, who must be allowed to have been such;
but it is to be hoped in the milder sense Lord
<i>Clarendon</i> often or always uses the epithet. The
making a subject of Mr. <i>St. André</i> is therefore
merely accidental. The writer expects to derive
no praise from exhibiting that person as the Hero
of a page. He thinks it is only doing justice (for
the Dead deserve justice as well as the Living)
when he draws his pen against some very injurious
insinuations, thrown out with more inadvertence
and at a venture than in malice, against
the memory of an acquaintance and of a foreigner
(to whom perhaps more mercy is due than to a
native), who is more roughly handled than he
appears to deserve.</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>Nathaniel St. André</i> came over, or rather
was brought over, very early from <i>Switzerland</i>,
his native country, in the train of a <i>Mendez</i>, or
<i>Salvadore</i>, or some <i>Jewish</i> family. Next to his
countryman <i>Heidegger</i>, he became the most considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
person that has been imported from thence.
He probably arrived in <i>England</i> in no better than
a menial station. Possibly his family was not
originally obscure, for he has been heard to declare,
that he had a rightful claim to a title, but
it was not worth while to take it up so late in life.
He had undoubtedly all the qualifications of a
<i>Swiss</i>. He talked <i>French</i> in all its provincial
dialects, and superintended the press, if the information
is to be depended upon, and perhaps
taught it, as his sister did at <i>Chelsea</i> boarding-school.
He was early initiated in music, for he
played upon some musical instrument as soon as
he was old enough to handle one, to entertain his
benefactors. He had the good fortune to be
placed by them with a surgeon of eminence, and
became very skilful in his profession. His duty
and gratitude to his father, whom he maintained
when he was no longer able to maintain himself,
was exemplary and deserving of high commendation.
Let this charity cover a multitude of his
sins! His great thirst for anatomical knowledge
(for which he became afterwards so famous as to
have books dedicated to him on that subject), and
his unwearied application, soon made him so compleat
an anatomist, that he undertook to read
public lectures (and he was the first in <i>London</i>
who read any), which gave general satisfaction.
The most ingenious and considerable men in the
kingdom became his pupils. Dr. <i>Hunter</i>, now at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
the head of his profession, speaks highly of his
predecessor, and considers him (if the information
is genuine) as the wonder of his time. He continued
his love of anatomy to the last, and left
noble preparations behind him, which he was
continually improving. The time of his introduction
into Mr. <i>Molyneux's</i> family is not known
to the writer of this account. Whether anatomy,
surgery, knowledge, or music, or his performance
on the <i>Viol de Gambo</i>, on which he was the greatest
master, got him the intimacy with Mr. <i>Molyneux</i>,
is not easy to determine. Certain it is, that he
attended his friend in his last illness, who died of
a dangerous disorder (but not under his hands),
which Mr. <i>Molyneux</i> is said to have pronounced,
from the first, would be fatal. Scandal, and Mr.
<i>Pope's</i> satirical half-line, talked afterwards of
'The Poisoning Wife.' She, perhaps, was in
too great a hurry, as the report ran, in marrying
when she did, according to the practised delicacy
of her sex, and her very high quality. The unlucky
business in which one <i>Howard</i>, a surgeon at
<i>Guildford</i>, involved him, who was the projector,
or accessary of the impudent imposture of <i>Mary
Tofts</i>, alias the Rabbit-woman of <i>Godalmin</i>, occasioned
him to become the talk and ridicule of the
whole kingdom. The report made by <i>St. André</i>,
and others, induced many inconsiderately to take
it for a reality. The public horror was so great,
that the rent of rabbit-warrens sunk to nothing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
and nobody, till the delusion was over, presumed
to eat a rabbit. The credulous <i>Whiston</i> believed
the story (for to some people every thing is credible
that comes from a credible witness), and wrote a
pamphlet, to prove this <i>monstrous conception</i> to be
the exact completion of an old prophecy in <i>Esdras</i>.
The part <i>St. André</i> acted in this affair ruined his
interest at Court, where he had before been so
great a favourite with King <i>George</i> I. that he presented
him with a sword which he wore himself.
Now, on his return out of the country, he met
with a personal affront, and never went to Court
again. But he continued anatomist to the Royal
Houshold to his dying day, though he never took
the salary. He probably was imposed upon in
this matter. And has it not been the lot of men,
in intellectual accomplishments vastly above his,
such as <i>Boyle</i>, for instance, a man infinitely his superior,
to be over-reached and misled? He took
up the pen on the occasion (and it was not the first
time, for he wrote some years before a bantering
pamphlet on Dr. <i>Mead</i>), which could at best but
demonstrate his sincerity, but exposed the weakness
of his judgement, on that case. It had been
insinuated he adopted this scheme, to ruin some
persons of his own profession. If he had a mind
to make an experiment upon the national belief,
and to tamper with their willingness to swallow
any absurdity (which a certain nobleman [Duke of
<i>Montagu</i>] ventured to do, in the affair of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
who undertook to jump into a quart bottle), he
was deservedly punished with contempt. <i>Swift</i>
(according to <i>Whiston</i>), and perhaps <i>Arbuthnot</i>, exercised
their pens upon him. The cheat was soon
discovered, and rabbits began to make their appearance
again at table as usual. But they were
not at his own table, nor made a dish, in any form
of cookery, at that of his friends. Perhaps
they imagined that the name or sight of that animal
might be as offensive to him, as the mention of
<i>Formosa</i> is said to have been to <i>Psalmanazar</i>. It
is told, that, on his asking for some parsly of a
market-woman of <i>Southampton</i>, and demanding
why she had not more to sell, she, in a banter, assured
him, 'That his rabbits had eat it up.'
The fortune he acquired by marrying into a noble
family (though it set all the lady's relations
against him, and occasioned her being dismissed
from her attendance on Queen <i>Caroline</i>) was a sufficient
compensation for the laughter or censure
of the publick. His high spirit and confidence
in himself made him superior to all clamor. So
that people did but talk about him, he seldom
seemed to care what they talked against him. And
yet he had the fortitude to bring an action for defamation
in <i>Westminster-Hall</i> against a certain doctor
in divinity, and got the better of his adversary.
He was not supposed, in the judgement of
the wiser and more candid part of mankind, to
have contributed, by any chirurgical administration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
to the death of his friend Mr. <i>Molyneux</i>, nor
to have set up the imposture at <i>Godalmin</i>. Though
he was disgraced at Court, he was not abandoned
by all his noble friends. The great Lord <i>Peterborough</i>,
who was his patron and patient long before
he went to <i>Lisbon</i>, entertained a very high
opinion of him to the last. His capacity in all
kinds, the reception he gave to his table and his
garden, with his liberality to the infirm and distressed,
made him visited by persons of the highest
quality, and by all strangers and foreigners. He
did not continue to enjoy the great fortune his
marriage is supposed to have brought him, to the
end of his life, for a great part went from him on
the death of Lady <i>Betty</i>. He by no means left so
much property behind him as to have it said, he
died rich. His profession as a surgeon, in a reasonable
terms of years, would probably have put
more money into his pocket than fell in the golden
shower so inauspiciously into his lap, and have
given him plenty, without envy or blame. He
was turned of ninety-six when he died; and
though subject to the gout, of which he used to
get the better by blisters upon his knees, and by
rigid abstinence, yet, when he took to his bed
(where he said he should not lie long), and permitted
a physician to be called in to him, he
cannot be said to have died of any disease. In
one sum of generosity, he gave the celebrated <i>Geminiani</i>
three hundred pounds, to help him to discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
his incumbrances, and to end his days in
comfort. The strength and agility of his body
were great, and are well known. He was famous
for his skill in fencing, in riding the great horse,
and for running and jumping, in his younger days.
He, at one time, was able to play the game at
chess with the best masters. After a slight instruction
at <i>Slaughter's</i> coffee-house, he did not
rest till, in the course of two nights sitting up, he
was able to vanquish his instructor. He was so
earnest in acquiring knowledge, that he whimsically,
as he told the story, cut off his eye-lashes,
that he might not sleep till he arrived at what he
wanted. His face was muscular and fierce. One
of his eyes, to external appearance, seemed to be
a mass of obscurity (as he expressed it of <i>Handel's</i>,
when he became stark-blind), at least it had not
the uncommon vivacity of the other. His language
was full of energy, but loaded with foreign
idioms. His conversation was seasoned sufficiently
with satire and irony, which he was not afraid to
display, though he ought never to have forgot
that he was once a proper subject for it. He
built; he planted; he had almost 'from the
Cedar of <i>Lebanon</i> to the hyssop that groweth
upon the wall,' in his hot-house, green-house,
and garden. If he was not deep in every art and
science (for even his long life was not sufficient
for universal attainment), he cannot be reckoned
to have been ignorant of any thing. He was admired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
for his knowledge in architecture, in gardening,
and in botany, by those who should have
been above flattery. But praise, from whatever
quarter it comes, is of an intoxicating nature.
Those who found out that he loved praise, took
care he should have enough of it. He kept a list
of the wretched and the indigent, whom he constantly
maintained; and their names might be
written alphabetically. The poor of <i>Southampton</i>
know they have lost their best friend. Call it,
reader, ostentation or vanity, if you will; but till
you know it did not proceed from his goodness
of heart, this tributary pen considers his giving
away his money to relieve the necessitous, as a
spark of the spirit of the Man of <i>Ross</i> or the Man
of <i>Bath</i>. He was all his life too much addicted
to amours, and sometimes with the lower part of
the sex. His conversation, which he was always
able to make entertaining and instructive, was too
often tinctured with <i>double entendre</i> (a vice that
increases with age), but hardly ever with prophaneness.
He may be thought to have copied
<i>Hermippus</i>, and to have considered women as the
prolongers of life. How far he was made a dupe
by any of them at last, is not necessary for relation.
He died, as he lived, without fear; for to his
standers-by he gave no sign of a ruffled mind, or
a disturbed conscience, in his last moments.</p>

<p>"If the preceding memoir of <i>St. André</i> had not
been composed entirely from memory (a faculty
which, like the sieve of the <i>Danaids</i>, is apt to lose
as much as it receives), and had not been conveyed
to the press with so much precipitancy, the writer,
by a second recollection, might have made supplementary
anecdotes less necessary. Whilst <i>St.
André</i> was basking in the sun-shine of public favour
in <i>Northumberland-Court</i>, near <i>Charing-Cross</i>,
under pretence of being wanted in his profession
at some house in the neighbourhood, he was hurried
through so many passages, and up and down
so many stair-cases, that he did not know where he
was, nor what the untoward scene was to end in,
till the horrid conclusion presented itself, of which
he published an extraordinary account in <i>The Gazette</i>
of <i>Feb.</i> 23, 1724-5, no less than of his being
poisoned, and of his more extraordinary recovery.
Such uncommon men must be visited through life
with uncommon incidents. The bowl of poison
must have been for ever present to his imagination.
<i>Socrates</i> himself could not expect more
certain destruction from the noxious draught he
was forced to take down, than seemed inevitable
to <i>St. André</i>. Nay, a double death seems to have
threatened him. Probably it was not any public or
private virtue for which <i>Socrates</i> was famous, and
which occasioned him to suffer, that endangered
our hero's life. His constitution was so good,
that he got the better of the internal potion. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
truth and circumstances of the story could only
be known to himself, who authenticated it upon
oath. His narrative partakes of the marvellous;
and the reader of <i>July</i>, 1781, is left in total ignorance
of the actor, and the provocation to such a
barbarous termination. His case was reported,
and he was attended, by the ablest of the faculty:
and the Privy Council issued a reward of two hundred
pounds towards a discovery. A note in the
second supplemental volume of <i>Swift</i> informed
the writer of this sketch, a day or two ago (who
takes to himself the reproof of <i>Prior</i>, 'Authors,
before they write, should read!'), that <i>St. André</i>
was convinced he had been imposed upon respecting
the woman of <i>Godalmin</i>, and that he apologised
handsomely to the public in an advertisement,
dated <i>Dec.</i> 8, 1726.&mdash;'He's half absolv'd,
who has confest.'&mdash;In the autumn, before the heat
of the town-talk on this affair was over, he was
sent for to attend Mr. <i>Pope</i>, who, on his return
home from <i>Dawley</i> in Lord <i>Bolingbroke's</i> coach
and six, was overturned in a river, and lost the use
of two fingers of his left-hand (happy for the
lovers of poetry they were not the servants of the
right one!), and gave him assurance, that none of
the broken glass was likely to be fatal to him. It
is highly improbable, that <i>Pope</i> and <i>Bolingbroke</i>
would have suffered <i>St. André</i> to have come near
them, if he had been branded as a cheat and an
impostor. He died in <i>March</i>, 1776, having survived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
all his contemporary enemies, and, which is
the consequence of living long, most of his ancient
friends. Such men do not arise every day for our
censure or our applause; to gratify the pen or the
pencil of character or caricature. He may be
considered, as <i>Voltaire</i> pronounces of <i>Charles</i> the
Twelfth, an extraordinary, rather than a great
man, and fitter to be admired than imitated.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 15em;">"<span class="smcap">Impartial</span>."</span></p>

<p>In the first place, I avow that the epithet <i>notorious</i>
was not meant to be employed in the milder sense of
Lord <i>Clarendon</i>. Had I undertaken to compile the
life of a man eminent for virtue, I should have been
happy to have borrowed the softer application of the
aforesaid term from our noble historian. But having
engaged to delineate a mere impostor's character,
there is greater propriety in adopting the disputed
word with that constant signification affixed to it by
the biographers of <i>Bet Canning</i>, or <i>Fanny</i> the Phantom
of <i>Cock Lane</i>.&mdash;I shall absolve myself no farther
from the charge of "malice," than by observing
that there are always people who think <i>somewhat
much too rough has been said of Chartres</i>.</p>

<p>The dead, declares our apologist, deserve justice
as well as their survivors. This is an uncontested
truth; nor will the precept be violated by me. I
may observe however, with impunity, that the interests
of the living, for whose sake a line of separation
between good and bad characters is drawn, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
be consulted, rather than the memories of the flagitious,
who can no longer be affected by human praise
or censure, should be spared.</p>

<p>Our apologist next assures us, that perhaps more
tenderness is due to a foreigner than to a native.
The boasted <i>amor patriæ</i> is not very conspicuous in
this remark, which indeed was dropped, to as little
purpose, by a learned counsel on the trial of the
<i>French Spy</i> who was lately executed.</p>

<p>"Next to his countryman <i>Heidegger</i>," adds our
apologist, "Mr. <i>St. André</i> became the most <i>considerable</i>
person that has been imported from <i>Switzerland</i>."
To judge of the comparative value of the
latter, we must estimate the merits of the former.
<i>Heidegger</i> is known to us only by the uncommon ugliness
of his visage, and his adroitness in conducting
Operas and Masquerades. If <i>St. André</i> is to be regarded
as a person still <i>less considerable</i> than <i>Heidegger</i>,
can his consequence be rated very high?</p>

<p>That <i>St. André</i> arrived here in a menial station, is
not improbable. The servility of his youth afforded
a natural introduction to the insolence of his riper
years. He was indeed (if I am not mis-informed)
of the same family with the fencing and dancing-master
whom <i>Dryden</i> has immortalized in <i>MacFlecknoe</i>;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<i>St. André's</i> feet ne'er kept more equal time;"<a name="FNanchor_1_325" id="FNanchor_1_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_325" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>and was intended for the same professions; a circumstance
often hinted at by his opponents during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
Rabbit controversy. Having been thus early instructed
in the management of the foil and kitt, no
marvel that he so often prated about the art of defence,
or that "his gratitude to his benefactors"
broke out in the language of a minuet or a rigadoon.</p>

<p>That he became famous enough in his profession
to have anatomical works occasionally dedicated to
him, will easily obtain credit among our apologist's
readers; for many of them must have seen a book
on surgery inscribed to Dr. <i>Rock</i>, a political poem
addressed to <i>Buckhorse</i>, and a treatise on religion
sheltering itself under the patronage of the late Lord
<i>Baltimore. St. André</i>, however, was not the earliest
reader of anatomical lectures in <i>London. Bussiere</i>,
the surgeon who attended <i>Guiscard</i> (the assassin of
<i>Harley</i>), was our hero's predecessor in this office, and
I am told even he was not the first who offered public
instructions to the students at our hospitals. Dr.
<i>Hunter</i>, who has been applied to for intelligence on
this occasion, declares that he never described <i>St.
André</i> as "the wonder of his time," but as a man
who had passed through no regular course of study,
and was competent only in the article of injections,
a task as happily suited to minute abilities as to
those of a larger grasp.</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Æmilium circà ludum faber imus et ungues<br />
Exprimet, et molles imitabitur ære capillos</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The art of pushing fluids through the vessels was
at that period a secret most scrupulously kept by the
few who were in possession of it, so that a great show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
might be made at the expence of little real knowledge.
I am also informed, that <i>St. André</i>, like the
workman described by <i>Horace</i>, had no general comprehension
of any subject, but was unable to have
put two propositions together:&mdash;that he neither extended
the bounds of the chirurgical art by discoveries,
nor performed any extraordinary cures; and,
boasting somewhere that he had detected vessels in
the cuticle or scarf-skin, a foreigner of eminence in
the same profession offered (through the medium of
a printed book) to lay him a wager of it, a challenge
which he prudently declined. I am also told, that
when solicited to exhibit his preparations, he always
declared the majority of them to have been destroyed
in a fire. What remain, I am instructed to add, deserve
little or no commendation. Thus, on enquiry,
sinks our "enthusiast in anatomy" down to a frigid
dabbler in the science; while his "noble preparations,
which he was continually improving," dwindle
into minutiæ of scarce any value.</p>

<p>Though the dreadful crime, which is indistinctly
mentioned in the text of the foregoing pamphlet, has
been alluded to with less reserve by the apologist of
<i>St. André</i>, it shall be explained no further on the
present occasion. Many are the common avenues to
death; and why should we point out with minuteness
such as we hope will never be explored again? Till
I perused the defence so often referred to, I had not
even suspected that the "poisoning wife"<a name="FNanchor_2_326" id="FNanchor_2_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_326" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
least allusion to any particular circumstance on the
records of criminal gallantry; nor, without stronger
proofs than are furnished by this expression (perhaps
a random one), shall I be willing to allot the smallest
share of blame to the Lady, such alone excepted as
must unavoidably arise from her over-hasty marriage,
which was solemnized at <i>Hesson</i> near <i>Hounslow</i> in <i>Middlesex</i>,
on the 27th of <i>May</i>, 1730. This act, however,
as well as her derogation from rank, being
mere offences against human customs, are cognizable
only upon earth.&mdash;By "the wiser and more candid
part of mankind," who suspected no harm
throughout <i>St. André's</i> conduct in this affair, I suppose
our apologist means any set of people who had
imbibed prejudices similar to his own, and thought
and spoke about his hero with equal partiality and
tenderness. But the Memoir on which these remarks
are founded, proves at least that what <i>J. N.</i> had
hinted concerning the death of Mr. <i>Molyneux</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_327" id="FNanchor_3_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_327" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
of no recent invention. So far from it indeed, that
<i>St. André</i> was openly taxed with having been the
sole cause of it, in a public news-paper (I think one
of the Gazetteers), by the Rev. Dr. <i>Madden</i>, the
celebrated <i>Irish</i> patriot, who subscribed his name to
his advertisement. It is related (I know not how
truly) that on this account our hero prosecuted and
"got the better of his adversary," whose accusation
was unsupported by such proofs as the strictness of
law requires. How many culprits, about whose guilt
neither judge nor jury entertains the smallest scruple,
escape with equal triumph through a similar defect
of evidence! I may add, that so serious a charge
would never have been lightly made by a divine of
Dr. <i>Madden's</i> rank and character.</p>

<p>All that is said on the subject of family honours
to which <i>St. André</i> was entitled, his gratitude to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
father, what he gave to the celebrated <i>Geminiani</i> "in
one sum of generosity," must be admitted with
caution, for truth was by no means the characteristic
of our hero's narrations.<a name="FNanchor_4_328" id="FNanchor_4_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_328" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These circumstances therefore
may be regarded as gasconades of his own. The
author of the defence pretends not to have received
any part of his information from <i>St. André's</i> countrymen
or contemporaries; but, on the contrary, confesses
that both his early friends and enemies had
long been dead.</p>

<p>The affair of the Rabbit-breeder has no need of
further illustration. Several ballads, pamphlets, prints,
&amp;c. on the subject, bear abundant testimony to <i>St.
André's</i> merits throughout that business, as well as
to the final opinion entertained of him by his contemporaries,
after <i>Cheselden</i>, by order of Queen <i>Caroline</i>,
had assisted in discovering the deceit. Her Majesty
was urged to this step by finding the plausibility
of our hero had imposed on the King, and that
some of the pregnant ladies about her own person
began to express their fears of bringing into the
world an unnatural progeny.&mdash;If Mr. <i>Boyle</i> was occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
misled, his errors were soon absorbed in
the blaze of his moral and literary excellence. <i>St.
André's</i> blunder, alas! had no such happy means of
redemption. His credulity indeed was not confined
to this single transaction. The following is a well-attested
story&mdash;Two gentlemen at <i>Southampton</i>, who
felt an inclination to banter him, broke a nutshell
asunder, filled the cavity with a large swan-shot, and
closed up the whole with glue so nicely that no
marks of separation could be detected. This curiosity,
as they were walking with <i>St. André</i>, one of
them pretended to pick up, admiring it as a nut
uncommonly heavy as well as beautiful. Our hero
swallowed the bait, dissected the subject, discovered
the lead, but not the imposition, and then proceeded
to account philosophically for so strange a phænomenon.
The merry wags could scarce restrain their
laughter, and soon quitted his company to enjoy the
success of a stratagem they had so adroitly practised
on his ignorance and gullibility.</p>

<p>Were there any colour for supposing he had patronized
the fraud relative to <i>Mary Tofts</i>, with design
to ruin others of his profession (an insinuation to his
discredit, which the foregoing pamphlet had not furnished),
it was but just that he should fall by his
own malevolence and treachery. From the imputation
of a scheme resembling that contrived by the
Duke of <i>Montagu</i>, his want of equal wit will sufficiently
absolve him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<p>That rabbits never were permitted to appear at
any table where he dined, is a strong mark of the
adulation paid to him by his entertainers. I hope,
for similar reasons, had he been seized with his last
illness in <i>London</i> (that his organs of hearing might
escape an equal shock), his attendants would not
have called any physician named <i>Warren</i> to his bed-side,
summoned an attorney from <i>Coney Court</i> Grays
Inn to have made his will, or sent for the Rev. Mr.
<i>Bunny</i> to pray by him. The banishment of rabbits,
however, from a neighbourhood that affords them
in the highest perfection, was a circumstance that
might as justly have been complained of, as <i>Pythagoras's</i>
prohibition of beans, had it been published in
<i>Leicestershire</i>. I heartily wish that the circumstantial
author of the preceding epistle, to relieve any doubts
by which futurity may be perplexed, had informed
us whether <i>St. André</i> was an eater of toasted cheese,
or not; and if it was never asked for by its common
title of a Welch <i>Rabbit</i> within his hearing.</p>

<p>That he wrote any thing, unless by proxy, or with
much assistance, may reasonably be doubted; for the
pamphlets that pass under his name are divested of
those foreign idioms that marked his conversation.
Indeed, if I may believe some specimens of his private
correspondence, he was unacquainted with the
very orthography of our language. The insolence
of this shallow <i>Switzer's</i> attempt to banter <i>Mead</i>, we
may imagine, was treated with contempt, as the
work described has not been handed down to us; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
few tracts are permitted to be scarce for any other
reason than because they are worthless.</p>

<p>It is next remarked by our apologist, that <i>St. André's</i>
"confidence, &amp;c. made him superior to all
clamour; and so that people did but talk about
him, he did not seem to care what they talked
against him." This is no more, in other language,
than to declare that his impudence and vanity were
well proportioned to each other, and that a bad character
was to him as welcome as a good one. He
did not, it seems, join in the Poet's prayer,</p>

<blockquote><p>
Grant me an honest fame, or grant me none!<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>but was of opinion, as his apologist likewise admits,
that wealth was an ample counterbalance to the loss
of reputation.&mdash;That he might evade accusation (as
I have already observed) in one particular instance,
and therefore recover damages, is no proof of his
innocence, that his general conduct would admit of
defence, or that much of the manifold censure
passed upon him had no foundation.</p>

<p>How Lord <i>Peterborough</i> happened to become his
patron, &amp;c. may be accounted for without any great
degree of credit to either party. His lordship (as
Lord <i>Orrery</i> observes) "in his private life and conduct
differed from most men;" and, having often
capricious disputes with the court, was sure to favour
those who, like <i>St. André</i>, had been dismissed from
its service. Our hero's musical talents, indeed, if
they were such as they have been represented, might
procure him access to his lordship and many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
noble adepts in the sublime and useful science of
harmony. The lovers of a tune urge no severe enquiries
concerning the heart of a fidler. If he be
a mercenary, while he teaches female pupils, he is
watched; and, if he performs in concerts, he is paid.
If above pecuniary gratifications, he is rewarded with
hyperbolical compliments. Articulate for inarticulate
sounds is ample retribution.</p>

<p>His defender adds, that he was visited by <i>all</i>
strangers and foreigners. It will be supposed then
that his house was never free from company. May
we not rather think, that if he was at any time sought
after by these peregrine worthies, &amp;c. it was because
the keepers of inns and mistresses of boarding-houses
had been instructed to disseminate attractive tales of
his "capacity in all kinds," his curiosities and good
dinners? Besides, all foreigners who have arrived in
<i>England</i> have not travelled to <i>Southampton</i>, and consequently
could not have seen <i>St. André</i>, who for
upwards of the last twenty years of his life had resided
only there. It is nearer the truth to say, that
not a single <i>Frenchman</i>, &amp;c. in fifty thousand, ever
heard of his name.</p>

<p>That "his profession as a surgeon, in a reasonable
term of years, would probably have put more
money in his pocket" than he gained by his union
with Lady <i>Betty Molyneux</i> (i. e. £30,000. a sum that
elevated him into a state little short of madness), I
cannot believe. The blast his reputation had received
respecting the business at <i>Godalming</i>, being seconded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
by his expulsion from court, he must have felt his
business on the decline. Indeed, I am told that he
staid long enough in town to try the experiment.
Marriage therefore might have been his <i>dernier resort</i>.</p>

<p>The exaggerations of this impostor's generosity and
accomplishments, which are next brought forward
by his panegyrist with no small degree of pomp, are
such as we may suppose himself would have furnished,
had he undertaken, like the Chevalier <i>Taylor</i>, to
compile his own memoirs. The majority of circumstances
collected for the purpose of proving him
to have been</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Grammaticus, rhetor, geometres, pictor, aliptes,<br />
Augur, schænobates, medicus, magus,</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>could only have been derived from those very flattering
testimonials to his merits which he was always
ready to exhibit on the slightest encouragement.
Those who were content to admit so partial an estimate
of his abilities, &amp;c. found it necessary to express
their belief that he could have beaten <i>Hercules</i> at
quoits, played a better fiddle than <i>Apollo</i>, out-witted
<i>Mercury</i>, disarmed the <i>God of War</i>, and forged
such chemic thunders, that, compared with the produce
of our hero's laboratory, the bolts of <i>Jove</i>
were no louder than a pot-gun. So far was he from
being deficient in commendation of his own talents,
that he thought his very furniture might claim a
proportionable extravagance of praise. He was possessed
of some foreign tapestry which he was proud
on all occasions to display. But the eulogiums of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
others, lavish as they might be, fell considerably
short of his own, so that the spectator retired with
disgust from an object which the excessive vanity of
its owner would not permit to be enjoyed without the
most frequent and nauseous intrusions of self-congratulation.</p>

<p>As to the history of his eye-lashes, which he sacrificed
to vigilance, and his sudden proficiency in the
very difficult game of chess (provided his instructor,
whom he afterwards vanquished, was a skilful one)
<i>credat Judæus Apella</i>.&mdash;That his language did not
want energy, may more easily be allowed, for force is
the characteristic of vulgar phraseology. Conceits,
expressed with much vigour, are current among sailors;
and such nervous denunciations of revenge may
occasionally be heard at <i>Billingsgate</i>, as might emulate
the ravings of <i>Dryden's Maximin</i>. No man will
be hardy enough to assert that the figure, manners,
and language, of <i>St. André</i>, were those of a gentleman.</p>

<p>If one of his eyes was a "mass of obscurity" (notwithstanding
the other, like that of Lady <i>Pentweazle's</i>
Great Aunt, might be a piercer), perhaps he
ought to have been sparing of his satire on the personal
disadvantages of his acquaintance. Yet, the
last time my informant saw him was at the Theatre
at <i>Southampton</i>, where, sitting near a gentleman and
lady not remarkable for handsome faces, he had the
modesty to express a doubt (and in a voice sufficiently
audible) which of the two would furnish the most
comic mask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>St. André's</i> apologist observes, that "he cannot
be reckoned to have been ignorant of any
thing." But the contrary may justly be suspected,
and for no inconclusive reason. I aver, that on
whatever subject he was haranguing, the moment he
discovered any of the company present understood it
as well as himself, he became silent, never choosing
to descant on art or science but before people whom
he supposed to be utter strangers to all their principles.
For this reason, he would have entertained Sir
<i>Joshua Reynolds</i> with remarks on the genera and cultivation
of plants, and talked to <i>Linnæus</i> about the
outline and colouring of pictures.</p>

<p>That he died poor (for such was really the case),
should excite no astonishment. His fortune, like his
good qualities, was chiefly in supposition. Much of
his wealth he had expended on buildings, which he
never long inhabited, and afterwards sold to disadvantage.
His first essays in architecture were made
at <i>Chepstow</i> on the <i>Severn</i>, an estate purchased by
Lady <i>Betty Molyneux</i> immediately after the death of
her husband. In short, our hero was a fugitive inhabitant
of several counties, and never settled till he
reached <i>Southampton</i>; for in no other place did he
meet with that proportion of flattery which was needful
to his happiness, if not to his existence.&mdash;About
a mile from hence he erected the whimsical baby-house
dignified by him with the title of <i>Belle-Vue</i>,
a receptacle every way inconvenient for the purposes
of a family. Being once asked if this was not a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
singular mansion,&mdash;"Singular!" (replied he) "by
G&mdash;I hope it is, or I would pull it down immediately.
I would have you to know, Sir, that it is
constructed on the true principles of anatomy."
The attempt to apply anatomical principles to the
arrangement of passages, doors, and windows, is too
glaring an absurdity to need animadversion, or to render
it necessary for me to deny in form, that he could
ever be "admired for his knowledge in architecture,"
except by such as knew not wherein its excellencies
consisted.&mdash;He had, however, another dwelling within
the walls of the town already mentioned. Here he
pretended that his upper apartments were crowded
with rarities, which he only wanted space to exhibit.
But, alas! after his decease, Mr. <i>Christie's</i> auction-room
bore abundant witness to the frivolity of his
collections. What became of his boasted library of
books, which he always said was packed up in boxes,
I am yet to learn. Perhaps it existed only in his
description.<a name="FNanchor_5_329" id="FNanchor_5_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_329" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Those who found out he loved praise (says his
apologist) took care he should have enough of it."
I discover little cause for disputing this assertion,
and shall only observe on it, that adulation is a commodity
which weak old men, reputed rich, and without
ostensible heirs, are seldom in danger of wanting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
though they may not enjoy so much of it as fell to
<i>St. André's</i> share.</p>

<p>His disbursements to the poor might be proportioned
to the real state of his fortune; but yet they
were conducted with excess of ostentation. He may
be said to have given shillings away with more parade
than many other men would have shown in the distribution
of as many guineas.&mdash;What honour his
apologist means to confer on him by saying that
"the names of those whom he maintained might be
written alphabetically," is to me a secret, because
names of every kind may be arranged according to
the series of the letters.&mdash;Suspected characters, however,
often strive to redeem themselves by affectation
of liberality. Few are more generous than opulent
wantons toward their decline of life, who thus attempt
to recover that respect which they are conscious
of having forfeited by the misdeeds of their
youth. The benefactions of such people may in
truth be considered as expiatory sacrifices for past
offences, having no foundation in a natural propensity
to relieve the indigent, or indulge the heart in
the noblest luxury, that of doing good.</p>

<p><i>St. André</i> was accused in <i>J. N.'s</i> pamphlet of having
frequently larded his pleasantry with obscene expressions.
This is a truth which his defender makes
not the slightest effort to deny; but adds, that his
conversation was <i>hardly ever</i> tinctured with prophaneness.
We hence at least may infer that our hero's
humour had <i>sometimes</i> this imperfection, which indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
might have escaped notice, but for the zeal of
his apologist.&mdash;As I am on this subject, I cannot forbear
to mention a particular in Mr. <i>St. André's</i> behaviour,
which hitherto has been overlooked. When
at any time he received a reproof from women of
sense, fashion, and character, whose ears he had insulted
with his ribaldry, his confidence in a moment
forsook him, nor had he a word to offer in extenuation
of his offence. My informant has more than
once beheld, with secret satisfaction, how effectually
the frown of steady virtue could awe this "mighty
impudent" into silence. Notwithstanding what
has been already said concerning that indifference to
censure which appeared in him towards the end of
his life, I am mis-informed, if at an earlier period
he was able to brave the ridicule of the place where
he had been once employed and caressed. When
the imputations consequent on his marriage, &amp;c. had
rendered him still less an object of respect, he retired
with his bride, and amused himself at a distance from
<i>London</i> with additions to his house, and improvements
in his garden; nor did he appear in public
again till what was known and suspected of him had
ceased to be the object of general enquiry and animadversion.</p>

<p>It is difficult for a profligate man of an amorous
constitution to grow old with decency. <i>J. N.'s</i>
pamphlet had taxed <i>St. André</i> with lasciviousness
unbecoming his years. This is silently admitted by
his apologist, who adds, that the intrigues of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
hero were "sometimes with the lower part of the
sex." He gives us reason also to suppose that our
antiquated enamorato was a dupe to females in the
very last stage of a life so unusually protracted. Is
<i>St. André's</i> memory much honoured by such revelations?
Do not circumstances like these increase that
stock of "injurious insinuations" which our apologist
professes to diminish?</p>

<p>Our panegyrist, more than once in the course of
his letter, has expressed himself in favourable terms
of <i>St. André's</i> colloquial talents. Now, as the memory
of my entertaining opponent in respect to circumstances
is remarkably tenacious, 'tis pity he has
preserved no splendid ebullition of his hero's wit, no
sample of that satire and irony that seasoned his conversation,
or of that wisdom which so often rendered
it instructive. I flatter myself, that if any specimens
of these distinct excellencies could have been recollected,
they would certainly have been arranged and
recorded.</p>

<p>That <i>St. André</i> expired without signs of terror, is
but a doubtful proof of his innocence. Being, at
best, a free-thinker, he might regard death as annihilation,
might have been insensible to its immediate
approaches, or have encountered it with a constitutional
firmness that was rather the gift of nature than
the result of conscience undisturbed. He who is
become indifferent to the value of reputation, will
not easily be inclined to suppose that a want of the
virtues on which it is founded will be punished in
a future state.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole narrative, published by <i>St. André</i> in
1723, was considered by his contemporaries as an
ostentatious falsehood, invented only to render him
an object of attention and commiseration. It should
be remembered, that his depositions were all delivered
on oath; and yet, being replete with facts totally
improbable (for his apologist allows "they
partake of the marvellous"), obtained no credit
from the world; a sufficient proof of the estimation
in which his moral character was held by the people
who were best acquainted with it, though at that
period (for the rabbit affair had not yet decided on
his reputation) he possessed sufficient interest as
court-surgeon to engage the privy-council in his
cause. They readily enough consented to offer a
sum which they might have been sure would never
be demanded. All the poison he was ever supposed
to have suffered from, was such as is commonly administered
in a more tempting vehicle than a glass of
strong liquor:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"'Twas that which taints the sweetest joys,<br />
And in the shape of Love destroys."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The bare mention of <i>Socrates</i> in company with such
a pretended victim as <i>St. André</i>, cannot fail to make
the reader smile.</p>

<p>But "He's half absolv'd who has confess'd," continues
his advocate, speaking of the recantation <i>St. André</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
made by public advertisement. Yet, what
did he confess? Why, what all the world concurred
to believe, that he had been grossly imposed on; or
perhaps that, out of two evils choosing the least, he
allowed himself to be a fool, that he might escape
the imputation of having proved a knave. His absolution
therefore was not obtained on the most creditable
terms. He adds, however, on this emergency,
a fresh proof of his disposition to deceive.
"I think myself obliged (says he) <i>in strict regard
to truth</i>, to acquaint the public that I intend, <i>in a
short time</i>, to publish a full account of the discovery,
with some considerations on the extraordinary
circumstances of this case, which misled me
in my apprehensions thereof; and which, as I hope
they will, in some measure, excuse the mistakes
made by myself and others who have visited the
woman concerned therein, will also be acceptable
to the world, in separating the innocent from those
who have been guilty actors in the fraud." This
work was never published, though <i>St. André</i> survived
his promise by the long term of fifty years. So
much for the faith thus solemnly pledged by an impostor
to the public.</p>

<p>After the accident had befallen Mr. <i>Pope</i>, on his
return from <i>Dawley</i> in Lord <i>Bolingbroke's</i> coach,
<i>St. André</i> was called in, because he happened to be
the surgeon nearest at hand. No man chooses to be
scrupulous in the moment of danger. It might be
urged that our hero had little to boast on the occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
because his patient never recovered the use
of his wounded fingers. But this calamity is not
strictly chargeable on <i>St. André's</i> want of skill; for
I have been assured, that though he stopped the effusion
of blood, the completion of the cure was entrusted
solely to another artist. The RABBITEER,
having received his fee, was not admitted a second
time into the Poet's company.</p>

<p>To conclude, I differ as much with our ingenious
apologist at the close of his Epistle as throughout
the foregoing parts of it, being of opinion that his
hero no more deserves to be <i>admired</i> than to be <i>copied</i>.
There is always hazard lest <i>wonder</i> should
generate <i>imitation</i>; and the world would not be much
obliged to any circumstance that produced a second
being fabricated on the model of <i>St. André</i>.</p>

of this work, the following particulars of this gentleman's
family appeared in the public prints: "Mr. <i>Molyneux</i>, who
was equally the friend of liberty and literature, was founder
of a society in <i>Ireland</i>, in imitation of the Royal (as was his
nephew, the Rev. Dr. <i>Madden</i>, of the <i>Dublin</i> Society). His
genius was celebrated by <i>Locke</i>, and other sages of those days;
and his patriotism was rewarded with the successive representation
of the City and University of <i>Dublin</i>, with other posts
of great trust, from the Revolution to his death. He married
the daughter of Sir <i>William Domville</i>, attorney-general of <i>Ireland</i>
in the reign of <i>Charles</i> the Second, and niece of Sir <i>Thomas
Leake</i>, of <i>Cannons</i> in <i>Middlesex</i>, by whom he had an only son,
<i>Samuel Molyneux</i>, Esq; secretary to his late Majesty when Prince
of <i>Wales</i>, a lord of the Admiralty, and member of parliament
both in <i>Great-Britain</i> and <i>Ireland</i>, who resembled his illustrious
father in his pursuits of philosophical knowledge, which he
many years, until engaged in political business, prosecuted
with great application at his seat at <i>Kew</i>, now his Majesty's,
and presented a telescope of his own construction to the King
of <i>Portugal</i>; his <i>perhaps fatal</i> acquaintance with and patronage
of <i>St. André</i> will make his name long remembered.
Leaving no issue by his wife, who married <i>St. André</i>, and lived
many years, the estate of Mr. <i>Molyneux</i> fell at her death to
his cousin-german and her god-son, the right honourable Sir
<i>Capel Molyneux</i>, member at present of the <i>Irish</i> parliament,
and a privy-counsellor, only surviving son of Mr. <i>Molyneux</i>
father's next brother, Sir <i>Thomas Molyneux</i>, bart. whom,
through regard for his nephew, his late Majesty created the
first <i>Irish</i> baronet upon his accession to the throne."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_328" id="Footnote_4_328"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_328"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The following story was told by <i>St. André</i> to an eminent
bookseller, from whom I received it:
</p>
<p>
"Once when I was in <i>Paris</i>," says our hero, "I went to
a sale of Missals, most of them bound in crimson velvet.
Among these, and in the same binding, I discovered a fine impression
of the Duke of <i>Orleans's</i> celebrated publication of <i>Les
Amours Pastorales de Daphnis et de Chloe</i>, &amp;c. which I purchased
for a mere trifle. On taking off the velvet, I found the cover
underneath was ornamented with as many jewels as I sold afterwards
for five hundred pounds."&mdash;&mdash;Who can believe a
circumstance so utterly improbable?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_329" id="Footnote_5_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_329"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> I am assured, on unquestionable authority, that Mr. <i>St.
André</i> had a valuable library in the classes of Natural History
and Medicine. A catalogue of it, drawn up by Mr.
<i>B. White</i>, is now in the possession of Mr. <i>St. André's</i> executor,
by whom it is reserved for the benefit of minors.</p></div>

<p>The kindness of a friend has enabled me to lay
before the reader some extracts from the scarce
pamphlet mentioned in p. 137. The following
is the exact title of it: "A Letter from a Parishioner
of <i>St. Clement Danes</i>, to the Right
Reverend Father in God <i>Edmund</i>, Lord Bishop
of <i>London</i>, occasioned by his Lordship's causing
the Picture over the Altar to be taken down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
With some Observations on the Use and Abuse
of Church Paintings in General, and of that
Picture in particular.</p>

<p>"<i>Exodus</i>, Chap. xxxii. Ver. 20. And he took
the Calf which they had made, and burnt it in
the Fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it
upon the Water, and made the Children of <i>Israel</i>
drink of it.</p>

<p>"<i>London</i>, printed and sold by <i>J. Roberts</i>, in <i>Warwick-Lane;
A. Dod</i>, without <i>Temple-Bar-</i>, and <i>E.
Nut</i>, at the <i>Royal-Exchange</i>. 1725. Price 6<i>d.</i>"</p>

<p>After some introductory compliments to Bishop
<i>Gibson</i>, the Letter-writer thus proceeds: "Of all
the abuses your Lordship has redressed, none more
timely, none more acceptable to all true Protestants,
than your last injunction to remove that ridiculous,
superstitious piece of Popish foppery
from over our communion-table; this has gained
you the applause and good will of all honest men,
who were scandalized to see that holy place defiled
with so vile and impertinent a representation.</p>

<p>"To what end or purpose was it put there, but
to affront our most gracious Sovereign, by placing
at our very altar the known resemblance of a
person, who is the wife of his utter enemy, and
pensioner to the Whore of <i>Babylon</i>?</p>

<p>"When I say the known resemblance, I speak
not only according to my own knowledge; but
appeal to all mankind who have seen the Princess
<i>Sobieski</i>, or any picture or resemblance of her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
if the picture of that angel in the white garment
and blue mantle, which is there supposed to
be beating time to the musick, is not directly a
great likeness of that princess. This I insist on,
and will stand and fall by my assertion, provided
they do not play any tricks with the picture, or
alter it for contradiction sake now it is down.</p>

<p>"Whether it was done by chance, or on purpose,
I shall not determine; but be it which it will, it
has given great offence, and your Lordship has
acted the part of a wise and good prelate to order
its removal.</p>

<p>"For surely, such a picture is far unfit for so sacred
a place; a place too solemn for such levities,
too awful to be made the receptacle of such trumpery:
nay, admit it were not the resemblance of
such a person, can any thing be more absurd, than
such a picture in such a place!</p>

<p>"But if it be the picture of that person, what can
be more sacrilegious, more impudently sacrilegious,
than to have our sanctuary defiled by those
who make a mock of us and our holy religion?
I mean, our inveterate enemies the Papists, who
would scruple to prophane no place, so they might
show their implacable hatred to our God, and our
King.</p>

<p>"To our God, by making his holy altar the
scene of their ribaldry, to be approached with
wantonness and curiosity, by the sons of <i>Belial</i>,
who come there to decypher the dumb libel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
sneer at the pictured lampoon, which tacitly
mocks the church, and openly affronts the State.</p>

<p>"To our King, by placing the resemblance of
an avowed enemy to him and his religion, at the
very altar, to stand in view of a whole congregation;
a thing, in my opinion, much more audacious,
than the setting up her statue in the public
streets.</p>

<p>"No wonder our church has been thronged with
spectators, to the great hindrance of divine worship,
and annoyance of the parishioners, when those
crouds of irreverend persons, which were ever
pouring in, came not there to join in prayer with
the rest of the congregation, but to worship their
Popish saint, and hug themselves with the conceit
of being alone in the secret.</p>

<p>"But at last the watch-word was blown, and the
true intent of their coming discovered. Then was
it high time to complain to your Lordship, when
disturbances became so frequent, and the peace of
the church was so manifestly broken: that you,
like another <i>Moses</i>, commanded the tinctured abomination
to be taken down, and no doubt but your
Lordship will call them to account who set it up.</p>

<p>"When your Lordship shall examine, who is the
painter, and of what principle? how long he
had been from the Court of <i>Rome</i>, before he painted
that picture? and whether he brought no picture,
or resemblance, of the Princess <i>Sobieski</i> over
with him? you will not repent of what you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
done. But when you shall farther enquire after
the person who employed him; whether he be a
Protestant? or, if he call himself so, whether his
children were not sent abroad to Popish seminaries
for education?</p>

<p>"When your Lordship, I say, shall examine into
these particulars, I doubt not of the inferences
so wise a man will draw from such convincing
circumstances.</p>

<p>"And as your Lordship has begun to redress one
abuse, I persuade myself you will not stop here,
but enquire likewise, by what authority it was put
there. This may, perhaps, open another scene to
your Lordship's view, and give you an opportunity,
not only to ease the parish of a very heavy
burden it now groans under, but prevent its being
run to unnecessary and unwarranted expences for
the future, by every <i>Jac&mdash;&mdash;-</i> in an office.</p>

<p>"And, indeed, unless there was a sufficient warrant
for such alterations, the workmen should go to
the right person's door, and he that set them to
work ought to pay them; for, in my humble opinion,
the place needed no alteration: it was decent,
convenient, and indeed ornamental enough before;
there was no more sign, or fear of its falling, than
there was occasion to take it down, and deprive
the parish of a conveniency now very much wanted,
I mean a little vestry-room, which was behind
the old communion table, where the books, vessels,
and vestments of the church, were ready at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
hand, and just at the very altar; whereas now
every thing is brought quite through the body of
the church, which in case of a croud (as of late
has been but too frequent) is both tedious and inconvenient
to the last degree.</p>

<p>"But, notwithstanding this, it was resolutely taken
down, to gratify the pride and malice of some
persons, who thirsted to eternize their names, and
affront the government. What have been the consequences
of all this, but an eye-sore and heart-burning
to the honest and loyal part of the inhabitants,
and a continual hurly-burly of loiterers
from all parts of the town, to see our Popish raree-show?"</p>

<p>After a digression on the famous altar at <i>White-Chapel</i>,
in which Dean <i>Kennet</i> was said to be satirized,
and some general observations on pictures
in churches, the Letter-writer adds, "Never before
was any Popish saint put over the communion-table
in a Protestant church. The Last Supper, the
Passion, Crucifixion, or some other incidents of
our Blessed Saviour's life, are the general subjects
given to painters on these occasions; but to have
a concert of musick, &amp;c. (suppose it were not the
Pretender's spouse, and probably some more of his
family, under the form of angels) is the most abrupt
and foreign that I ever saw or heard of.</p>

<p>"What surprizes me most is, that any of my fellow
parishioners should not only dispute your Lordship's
commands, delay the execution of your just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
injunction, when it was most reasonable and necessary,
but pester your Lordship with impertinent
petitions and remonstrances, as if they were injured
and oppressed, or your Lordship misinformed.
This must be the reason; or to what purpose
did they trifle with and contest your Lordship's
ordinance? But you are too just a man to give any
sentence but the most impartial, and too steady to
give up any point, where the peace of the Church
and the honour of the King is concerned.</p>

<p>"Whoever murmurs at its being taken down,
takes the part of those who set it up; and whoever
takes their part, is as bad as themselves, and
would do the like on the like opportunity. What
can they object against its being removed? What
can they offer for having it remain? But why's,
and why not's. As, Why should it be removed?
What hurt did it do? Why should so much
money be thrown away? And, why might not
that picture be there as well as any other? Why
does your Lordship interfere in the matter? This,
with a glance of complaint at your Lordship, and
severe invectives against those who solicited that
interposition, calling them informers, busy, forward,
mischief-making fellows, who had better
mind their own business, and such like ribaldry,
is all they can say for themselves. But these are
the worst reasons in the world, and invidious queries
only to evade an argument, and are not to be
admitted in a debate of this nature, where a direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
reason for, or against, is required. But give me
leave, my Lord, and I will, in a few words, answer
all their queries, which seem so weighty and formidable
to the vulgar and ignorant.</p>

<p>"Why should it be removed? may be answered
by another question, What business had it there?
But as I scorn such quibbling ways of reasoning,
I shall answer them, because it is unfit for that
sacred place. If it is the Princess <i>Sobieski's</i> image,
it is sacrilegious and traiterous, and therefore ought
to be removed. If it is, as they say, a choir of
heavenly angels at a practice of musick, playing
on earthly instruments, it is impertinent and absurd
to the last degree, and therefore ought to be removed
from a place where the utmost decorum
should be kept.</p>

<p>"What hurt does it, say they? To which I answer,
it hurted or disturbed the peace of the
church, and was so far hurtful, as we were hindered
or annoyed in our devotions; it made a division
in the parish, and was so far hurtful, as it
tended to the breach of peace and good neighbourhood;
and therefore I think it ought to be
removed, since, not to answer them with a question,
but a common saying, it did hurt enough.</p>

<p>"Why should so much money be thrown away?
Ay, there's the grievance; but I shall tell them,
they may thank themselves, it was the act and
deed of their own cabal; and though they might
triumph and laugh in their sleeves for a while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
yet murder will out, and they might expect to be
paid in their own coin one time or other. There
was no occasion to remove the old communion-table
and vestry; and therefore all the money is
thrown away; the worse their management. Nor
was there any necessity of so sumptuous an altar-piece,
or of that picture in particular, therefore
so much money as that picture cost, which, by the
bye, is no trifling sum<a name="FNanchor_1_330" id="FNanchor_1_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_330" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (the painter, as well as
his masters, being no small fool), is entirely thrown
away, and has been cast into <i>The Thames</i>; or, as
the vulgar have it, thrown down the kennel.</p>

<p>"It was set up against the will of the major part
of the parish, and not without much murmur and
complaint; there was yet a much greater majority
for pulling it down; if therefore so much money
is thrown away, it is pity the parish should pay it;
and, no doubt, when your Lordship comes to enquire
by what authority a set of men ran the parish
so much in debt for their own whims, and
without any manner of occasion, you will do us
justice, and teach such persons for the future to
consult the bishop, and have the general consent
of the parish, before they run into such extravagancies.</p>

<p>"The tradesmen want their money, and the parish
cannot pay them: your Lordship therefore will do
very well to adjust this matter, that they may know
where to go for their money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span></p>

<p>"Their delaying to take down their idol, was a
tacit disputing your lordship's commands, irreligious
and contumacious to the last degree: and indeed
I cannot say but some of the public prints<a name="FNanchor_2_331" id="FNanchor_2_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_331" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
gave me great anxiety, when they had the impudence
to assure the world it was not to be taken
down: but that anxiety was of short continuance;
for I had the satisfaction the next morning to find
it removed, and whole crowds of idle persons who
came to see it disappointed; then I found, to my
great comfort, that you were not to be biassed;
but, as you had begun the good work, you had
gone through with it, and made them take it
down with a witness."</p>

From <i>Covent-Garden</i> took departure,                       <span class="linenum">5</span><br />
To see the world by land and water.<br />
<br />
Our march we with a song begin;<br />
Our hearts were light, our breeches thin.<br />
We meet with nothing of adventure<br />
Till <i>Billingsgate's Dark-house</i> we enter;                <span class="linenum">10</span><br />
Where we diverted were, while baiting,<br />
With ribaldry, not worth relating,<br />
(Quite suited to the dirty place):<br />
But what most pleas'd us was his Grace<br />
Of <i>Puddle Dock</i>, a porter grim,                          <span class="linenum">15</span><br />
Whose portrait <i>Hogarth</i>, in a whim,<br />
Presented him in caricature,<br />
He pasted on the cellar-door.<a name="FNanchor_1_332" id="FNanchor_1_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_332" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span><br />
But hark! the Watchman cries "Past one!"<br />
'Tis time that we on board were gone.                          <span class="linenum">20</span><br />
Clean straw we find laid for our bed,<br />
A tilt for shelter over head.<br />
The boat is soon got under sail,<br />
Wind near S. E. a mackrel gale,<br />
Attended by a heavy rain;                                      <span class="linenum">25</span><br />
We try to sleep, but try in vain,<br />
So sing a song, and then begin<br />
To feast on biscuit, beef, and gin.<br />
<br />
At <i>Purfleet</i> find three men of war,<br />
The <i>Dursley</i> galley, <i>Gibraltar</i>,                   <span class="linenum">30</span><br />
And <i>Tartar</i> pink, and of this last<br />
The pilot begg'd of us a cast<br />
To <i>Gravesend</i>, which he greatly wanted,<br />
And readily by us was granted.<br />
The grateful man, to make amends,                              <span class="linenum">35</span><br />
Told how the officers and friends<br />
Of <i>England</i> were by <i>Spaniards</i> treated,<br />
And shameful instances repeated.<br />
<br />
While he these insults was deploring,<br />
<i>Hogarth</i>, like Premier, fell to snoring,                 <span class="linenum">40</span><br />
But waking cry'd, "I dream'd"&mdash;and then<br />
Fell fast asleep, and snor'd again.<br />
<br />
The morn clear'd up, and after five<br />
At port of <i>Gravesend</i> we arrive,<br />
But found it hard to get on shore;                             <span class="linenum">45</span><br />
His boat a young son of a whore<br />
Had fix'd just at our landing-place,<br />
And swore we should not o'er it pass;<br />
But, spite of all the rascal's tricks,<br />
We made a shift to land by six,                                <span class="linenum">50</span><br />
And up to Mrs. <i>Bramble's</i> go<br />
[A house that we shall better know],<br />
There get a barber for our wigs,<br />
Wash hands and faces, stretch our legs,<br />
Had toast and butter, and a pot                                <span class="linenum">55</span><br />
Of coffee (our third breakfast) got:<br />
Then, paying what we had to pay,<br />
For <i>Rochester</i> we took our way,<br />
Viewing the new church as we went,<br />
And th' unknown person's monument.                             <span class="linenum">60</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span><br />
The beauteous prospects found us talk.<br />
And shorten'd much our two hours walk,<br />
Though by the way we did not fail<br />
To stop and take three pots of ale,<br />
And this enabled us by ten                                     <span class="linenum">65</span><br />
At <i>Rochester</i> to drink again.<br />
<br />
Now, Muse, assist, while I declare<br />
(Like a true <i>English</i> traveller)<br />
What vast variety we survey<br />
In the short compass of one day.                               <span class="linenum">70</span><br />
<br />
We scarce had lost the sight of <i>Thames</i>,<br />
When the fair <i>Medway's</i> winding streams,<br />
And far-extending <i>Rochester</i>,<br />
Before our longing eyes appear:<br />
The Castle and Cathedral grace                                 <span class="linenum">75</span><br />
One prospect, so we mend our pace;<br />
Impatient for a nearer view,<br />
But first must <i>Strood's</i> rough street trudge through,<br />
And this our feet no short one find;<br />
However, with a cheerful mind,                                 <span class="linenum">80</span><br />
All difficulties we get o'er,<br />
And soon are on the <i>Medway's</i> shore.<br />
New objects here before us rise,<br />
And more than satisfy our eyes,<br />
The stately Bridge from side to side,                          <span class="linenum">85</span><br />
The roaring cataracts of the tide,<br />
Deafen our ears, and charm our sight,<br />
And terrify while they delight.<br />
These we pass over to the Town,<br />
And take our Quarters at <i>The Crown</i>,                     <span class="linenum">90</span><br />
To which the Castle is so near,<br />
That we all in a hurry were<br />
The grand remains on't to be viewing;<br />
It is indeed a noble ruin,<br />
Must have been very strong, but length                         <span class="linenum">95</span><br />
Of time has much impair'd its strength:<br />
The lofty Tower as high or higher<br />
Seems than the old Cathedral's spire;<br />
Yet we determin'd were to gain<br />
Its top, which cost some care and pain;                       <span class="linenum">100</span><br />
When there arriv'd, we found a well,<br />
The depth of which I cannot tell;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>Small holes cut in on every side<br />
Some hold for hands and feet provide,<br />
By which a little boy we saw                                  <span class="linenum">105</span><br />
Go down, and bring up a jack-daw.<br />
<br />
All round about us then we gaze,<br />
Observing, not without amaze,<br />
How towns here undistinguish'd join,<br />
And one vast One to form combine.                             <span class="linenum">110</span><br />
<i>Chatham</i> with <i>Rochester</i> seems but one,<br />
Unless we're shewn the boundary-stone.<br />
That and its Yards contiguous lie<br />
To pleasant <i>Brompton</i> standing high;<br />
The Bridge across the raging flood                            <span class="linenum">115</span><br />
Which <i>Rochester</i> divides from <i>Strood</i>,<br />
Extensive <i>Strood</i>, on t'other side,<br />
To <i>Frindsbury</i> quite close ally'd:<br />
The country round, and river fair,<br />
Our prospects made beyond compare,                            <span class="linenum">120</span><br />
Which quite in raptures we admire;<br />
Then down to face of earth retire.<br />
<br />
Up the Street walking, first of all<br />
We take a view of the Town-Hall.<br />
Proceeding farther on, we spy                                 <span class="linenum">125</span><br />
A house, design'd to catch the eye,<br />
With front so rich, by plastick skill,<br />
As made us for a while stand still:<br />
Four huge Hobgoblins grace the wall,<br />
Which we four Bas Relievo's call;                             <span class="linenum">130</span><br />
They the four Seasons represent,<br />
At least were form'd for that intent.<br />
<br />
Then <i>Watts's Hospital</i> we see<br />
(No common curiosity):<br />
Endow'd (as on the front appears)                             <span class="linenum">135</span><br />
In favour of poor travellers;<br />
Six such it every night receives,<br />
Supper and lodging <i>gratis</i> gives,<br />
And to each man next morn does pay<br />
A groat, to keep him on his way:                              <span class="linenum">140</span><br />
But the contagiously infected,<br />
And rogues and proctors, are rejected.<br />
<br />
It gave us too some entertainment<br />
To find out what this bounteous man meant.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>Yet were we not so highly feasted,                            <span class="linenum">145</span><br />
But that we back to dinner hasted.<br />
<br />
By twelve again we reach <i>The Crown</i>,<br />
But find our meat not yet laid down,<br />
So (spite of "Gentlemen, d'ye call?")<br />
On chairs quite fast asleep we fall,                          <span class="linenum">150</span><br />
And with clos'd eyes again survey,<br />
In dreams, what we have seen to-day:<br />
Till dinner's coming up, when we<br />
As ready are as that can be.<br />
<br />
If we describe it not, we're undone,                          <span class="linenum">155</span><br />
You'll scarce believe we came from <i>London</i>.<br />
With due attention then prepare<br />
Yourself to hear our bill of fare.<br />
For our first course a dish there was<br />
Of soles and flounders with crab-sauce,                       <span class="linenum">160</span><br />
A stuff'd and roast calf's-heart beside,<br />
With 'purt'nance minc'd, and liver fry'd;<br />
And for a second course, they put on<br />
Green pease and roasted leg of mutton:<br />
The cook was much commended for't;                            <span class="linenum">165</span><br />
Fresh was the beer, and sound the port:<br />
So that <i>nem. con.</i> we all agree<br />
(Whatever more we have to see)<br />
From table we'll not rise till three.<br />
<br />
Our shoes are clean'd, 'tis three o'clock,                    <span class="linenum">170</span><br />
Come let's away to <i>Chatham-Dock</i>;<br />
We shan't get there till almost four,<br />
To see't will take at least an hour;<br />
Yet <i>Scott</i> and <i>Hogarth</i> needs must stop<br />
At the Court-Hall to play <i>Scotch</i> hop.                  <span class="linenum">175</span><br />
<br />
To <i>Chatham</i> got, ourselves we treat<br />
With Shrimps, which as we walk we eat.<br />
For speed we take a round-a-bout-<br />
way, as we afterwards found out:<br />
At length reach the King's yards and docks,                   <span class="linenum">180</span><br />
Admire the ships there on the stocks,<br />
The men of war afloat we view,<br />
Find means to get aboard of two;<a name="FNanchor_2_333" id="FNanchor_2_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_333" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><br />
But here I must not be prolix,<br />
For we went home again at six,                                <span class="linenum">185</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>There smoak'd our pipes, and drank our wine,<br />
And comfortably sat till nine,<br />
Then, with our travels much improv'd,<br />
To our respective beds we mov'd.<br />
<br />
<i>Sunday</i> at seven we rub our eyes,                       <span class="linenum">190</span><br />
But are too lazy yet to rise:<br />
<i>Hogarth</i> and <i>Thornhill</i> tell their dreams,<br />
And, reasoning deeply on those themes,<br />
After much learned speculation,<br />
Quite suitable to the occasion,                               <span class="linenum">195</span><br />
Left off as wise as they begun,<br />
Which made for us in bed good fun.<br />
<br />
But by and by, when up we got,<br />
<i>Sam Scott</i> was missing, "Where's <i>Sam Scott</i>?"<br />
"Oh! here he comes. Well! whence come you?"                   <span class="linenum">200</span><br />
"Why from the bridge, taking a view<a name="FNanchor_3_334" id="FNanchor_3_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_334" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br />
Of something that did highly please me,<br />
But people passing by would teaze me<br />
With 'Do you work on <i>Sundays</i>, friend?'<br />
So that I could not make an end."                             <span class="linenum">205</span><br />
<br />
At this we laugh'd, for 'twas our will<br />
Like men of taste that day to kill.<br />
So after breakfast we thought good<br />
To cross the bridge again to <i>Strood</i>:<br />
Thence eastward we resolve to go,                             <span class="linenum">210</span><br />
And through the Hundred march of <i>Hoo</i>,<br />
Wash'd on the north side by the <i>Thames</i>,<br />
And on the south by <i>Medway's</i> streams.<br />
Which to each other here incline,<br />
Till at <i>The Nore</i> in one they join.                     <span class="linenum">215</span><br />
<br />
Before we <i>Frindsbury</i> could gain,<br />
There fell a heavy shower of rain,<br />
When crafty <i>Scott</i> a shelter found<br />
Under a hedge upon the ground,<br />
There of his friends a joke he made,                          <span class="linenum">220</span><br />
But rose most woefully bewray'd;<br />
How against him the laugh was turn'd,<br />
And he the vile disaster mourn'd!<br />
We work, all hands, to make him clean,<br />
And fitter to be smelt and seen.                              <span class="linenum">225</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>But, while we scrap'd his back and side,<br />
All on a sudden, out he cried,<br />
"I've lost my cambrick handkercher,<br />
'Twas lent me by my wife so dear:<br />
What I shall do I can't devise,                              <span class="linenum">230</span><br />
I've nothing left to wipe my eyes."<br />
<br />
At last the handkerchief was found,<br />
To his great comfort, safe and sound,<br />
He's now recover'd and alive;<br />
So in high spirits all arrive                                <span class="linenum">235</span><br />
At <i>Frindsbury</i>, fam'd for prospects fair,<br />
But we much more diverted were<br />
With what the parish church did grace,<br />
"A list of some who lov'd the place,<br />
In memory of their good actions,                             <span class="linenum">240</span><br />
And gratitude for their benefactions.<br />
Witness our hands&mdash;<i>Will. Gibbons</i>, Vicar&mdash;"<br />
And no one else.&mdash;This made us snicker:<br />
At length, with countenances serious,<br />
We all agreed it was mysterious,                             <span class="linenum">245</span><br />
Not guessing that the reason might<br />
Be, the Churchwardens could not write.<br />
<br />
At ten, in council it was mov'd,<br />
Whoe'er was tir'd, or disapprov'd<br />
Of our proceedings, might go back,                           <span class="linenum">250</span><br />
And cash to bear his charges take.<br />
With indignation this was heard:<br />
Each was for all events prepar'd.<br />
So all with one consent agreed<br />
To <i>Upnor-Castle</i> to proceed,                           <span class="linenum">255</span><br />
And at the sutler's there we din'd<br />
On such coarse fare as we could find.<br />
<br />
The Castle<a name="FNanchor_4_335" id="FNanchor_4_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_335" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was not large, but strong,<br />
And seems to be of standing long.<br />
Twenty-four men its garrison,                                <span class="linenum">260</span><br />
And just for every man a gun;<br />
Eight guns were mounted, eight men active,<br />
The rest were rated non-effective.<br />
Here an old couple, who had brought<br />
Some cockles in their boat, besought                         <span class="linenum">265</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>That one of us would buy a few,<br />
For they were very fresh and new.<br />
I did so, and 'twas charity;<br />
He was quite blind, and half blind she.<br />
<br />
Now growing frolicksome and gay,                             <span class="linenum">270</span><br />
Like boys, we, after dinner, play,<br />
But, as the scene lay in a fort,<br />
Something like war must be our sport:<br />
Sticks, stones, and hogs-dung, were our weapons,<br />
And, as in such frays oft it happens,                        <span class="linenum">275</span><br />
Poor <i>Tothall's</i> cloaths here went to pot,<br />
So that he could not laugh at <i>Scott</i>.<br />
<br />
From hence all conquerors we go<br />
To visit the church-yard at <i>Hoo</i>.<br />
At <i>Hoo</i> we found an Epitaph,                           <span class="linenum">280</span><br />
Which made us (as 'twill make you) laugh:<br />
A servant maid, turn'd poetaster,<br />
Wrote it in honour of her master;<br />
I therefore give you (and I hope you<br />
Will like it well) a <i>Vera Copia</i>:                      <span class="linenum">285</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And.wHen.he.Died.You plainly.see</span><br />

<br />
While here among the Graves we stumble,<br />
Our <i>Hogarth's</i> guts began to grumble,<br />
Which he to ease, turn'd up his tail<br />
Over a monumental rail;                                      <span class="linenum">295</span><br />
<i>Tothall</i>, for this indecent action,<br />
Bellowing on him just correction<br />
With nettles, as there was no birch,<br />
He fled for refuge to the church,<br />
And shamefully the door besh-t;                              <span class="linenum">300</span><br />
O filthy dauber! filthy wit!<br />
<br />
Long at one place we must not stay,<br />
'Tis almost four, let's haste away.<br />
But here's a sign; 'tis rash we think,<br />
To leave the place before we drink.                          <span class="linenum">305</span><br />
We meet with liquor to our mind,<br />
Our hostess complaisant and kind:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>She was a widow, who, we found,<br />
Had (as the phrase is) been shod round,<br />
That is, had buried husbands four,                           <span class="linenum">310</span><br />
And had no want of charms for more;<br />
Yet her we leave, and, as we go,<br />
<i>Scott</i> bravely undertook to show<br />
That through the world we could not pass,<br />
How thin soe'er our breeches was;                            <span class="linenum">315</span><br />
"'Tis true, indeed, we may go round,<br />
But through"&mdash;then pointed to the ground.<br />
So well he manag'd the debate,<br />
We own'd he was a man of weight:<br />
And so indeed he was this once,                              <span class="linenum">320</span><br />
His pockets we had fill'd with stones:<br />
But here we'd serv'd ourselves a trick,<br />
Of which he might have made us sick:<br />
We'd furnish'd him with ammunition<br />
Fit to knock down all opposition;                            <span class="linenum">325</span><br />
And, knowing well his warmth of temper,<br />
Out of his reach began to scamper,<br />
Till, growing cooler, he pretends<br />
His passion feign'd, so all are friends.<br />
Our danger now becomes a joke,                               <span class="linenum">330</span><br />
And peaceably we go to <i>Stoke</i>.<br />
About the church we nothing can see<br />
To strike or entertain our fancy:<br />
But near a farm, on an elm tree,<br />
A long pole fix'd upright we see,                            <span class="linenum">335</span><br />
And tow'rd the top of it was plac'd<br />
A weathercock, quite in high taste,<br />
Which all of us, ere we go further,<br />
Pronounce of the Composite order.<br />
<br />
First, on a board turn'd by the wind,                        <span class="linenum">340</span><br />
A painter had a cock design'd,<br />
A common weather-cock was above it,<br />
This turn'd too as the wind did move it;<br />
Then on the spindle's point so small<br />
A shuttlecock stuck o'ertopp'd them all.                     <span class="linenum">345</span><br />
<br />
This triple alliance gave occasion<br />
To much improving speculation.<br />
<br />
Alas! we ne'er know when we are well,<br />
So at <i>Northfleet</i> again must quarrel;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>But fought not here with sticks and stones                  <span class="linenum">350</span><br />
(For those, you know, might break our bones)!<br />
A well just by, full to the brim,<br />
Did fitter for our purpose seem;<br />
So furiously we went to dashing,<br />
Till our coats wanted no more washing;                      <span class="linenum">355</span><br />
But this our heat and courage cooling,<br />
'Twas soon high time to leave such fooling.<br />
To <i>The Nag's Head</i> we therefore hie,<br />
To drink, and to be turn'd adry.<br />
<br />
At six, while supper was preparing,                         <span class="linenum">360</span><br />
And we about the marsh-lands staring,<br />
Our two game-cocks, <i>Tothall</i> and <i>Scott</i>,<br />
To battling once again were got:<br />
But here no weapons could they find,<br />
Save what the cows dropp'd from behind;                     <span class="linenum">365</span><br />
With these they pelted, till we fancy<br />
Their cloaths look'd something like a tansy.<br />
<br />
At seven we all come home again,<br />
<i>Tothall</i> and <i>Scott</i> their garments clean;<br />
Supper we get, and, when that's o'er,                       <span class="linenum">370</span><br />
A tiff of punch drink at the door;<br />
Then, as the beds were only three,<br />
Draw cuts who shall so lucky be<br />
As here to sleep without a chum;<br />
To <i>Tothall's</i> share the prize did come                <span class="linenum">375</span><br />
<i>Hogarth</i> and <i>Thornhill, Scott</i> and I,<br />
In pairs, like man and wife, must lie.<br />
Then mighty frolicksome they grow,<br />
At <i>Scott</i> and me the stocking throw,<br />
Fight with their wigs, in which perhaps                     <span class="linenum">380</span><br />
They sleep, for here we found no caps.<br />
<br />
Up at eleven again we get,<br />
Our sheets were so confounded wet;<br />
We dress, and lie down in our cloaths;<br />
<i>Monday</i>, at three, awak'd and rose,                   <span class="linenum">385</span><br />
And of the cursed gnats complain,<br />
Yet make a shift to sleep again.<br />
<br />
Till six o'clock we quiet lay,<br />
And then got out for the whole day;<br />
To fetch a barber, out we send;                             <span class="linenum">390</span><br />
Stripp'd, and in boots, he does attend,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>For he's a fisherman by trade;<br />
Tann'd was his face, shock was his head;<br />
He flours our wigs, and trims our faces,<br />
And the top barber of the place is.                         <span class="linenum">395</span><br />
The cloth is for our breakfast spread;<br />
A bowl of milk and toasted bread<br />
Are brought, of which while <i>Forrest</i> eats.<br />
To draw our pictures <i>Hogarth</i> sits;<a name="FNanchor_5_336" id="FNanchor_5_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_336" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br />
<i>Thornhill</i> is in the barber's hands,                  <span class="linenum">400</span><br />
Shaving himself <i>Will Tothall</i> stands;<br />
While <i>Scott</i> is in a corner sitting,<br />
And an unfinish'd piece completing.<br />
<br />
Our reckoning about eight we pay,<br />
And take for Isle of <i>Greane</i> our way;                 <span class="linenum">405</span><br />
To keep the road we were directed,<br />
But, as 'twas bad, this rule neglected;<br />
A tempting path over a stile<br />
Let us astray above a mile;<br />
Yet the right road at last we gain,                         <span class="linenum">410</span><br />
And joy to find ourselves at <i>Greane</i>;<br />
Where my Dame <i>Husbands</i>, at <i>The Chequer</i>,<br />
Refresh'd us with some good malt liquor;<br />
Into her larder then she runs,<br />
Brings out salt pork, butter and buns,                      <span class="linenum">415</span><br />
And coarse black bread; but that's no matter,<br />
'Twill fortify us for the water.<br />
Here <i>Scott</i> so carefully laid down<br />
His penknife which had cost a crown,<br />
That all in vain we sought to find it,                      <span class="linenum">420</span><br />
And, for his comfort, say, "Ne'er mind it;"<br />
For to <i>Sheerness</i> we now must go:<br />
To this the ferryman says, "No."<br />
We to another man repair'd:<br />
He too says, "No&mdash;it blows too hard."                       <span class="linenum">425</span><br />
But, while we study how to get there<br />
In spite of this tempestuous weather,<br />
Our landlady a scheme propos'd,<br />
With which we fortunately clos'd,<br />
Was to the shore to go, and try                             <span class="linenum">430</span><br />
To hail the ships in ordinary,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>So we might get, for no great matter,<br />
A boat to take us o'er the water.<br />
We haste, and soon the shore we tread,<br />
With various kinds of shells bespread.                      <span class="linenum">435</span><br />
And in a little time we spy'd<br />
A boat approaching on our side;<br />
The man to take us in agreed,<br />
But that was difficult indeed,<br />
Till, holding in each hand an oar,                          <span class="linenum">440</span><br />
He made a sort of bridge to shore,<br />
O'er which on hands and knees we crawl,<a name="FNanchor_6_337" id="FNanchor_6_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_337" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br />
And so get safe on board the yawl.<br />
<br />
In little time we seated were,<br />
And now to <i>Shepey's</i> coast draw near;                 <span class="linenum">445</span><br />
When suddenly, with loud report,<br />
The cannons roar from ships and fort,<br />
And, like tall fellows, we impute<br />
To our approach this grand salute:<br />
But soon, alas! our pride was humbled,                      <span class="linenum">450</span><br />
And from this fancy'd height we tumbled,<br />
On recollecting that the day<br />
The nine and twentieth was of <i>May</i>.<br />
<br />
The firing had not long been ended.<br />
Before at <i>Sheerness</i> we were landed,                  <span class="linenum">455</span><br />
Where on the battery while we walk,<br />
And of the charming prospect talk,<br />
<i>Scott</i> from us in a hurry runs,<br />
And, getting to the new-fir'd guns,<br />
Unto their touch-holes clapp'd his nose;                    <span class="linenum">460</span><br />
<i>Hogarth</i> sits down, and trims his toes;<br />
These whims when we had made our sport,<br />
Our turn we finish round the fort,<br />
And are at one for <i>Queenborough</i> going:<br />
Bleak was the walk, the wind fierce blowing,                <span class="linenum">465</span><br />
And driving o'er our heads the spray;<br />
On loose beach stones, our pebbly way,<br />
But <i>Thornhill</i> only got a fall,<br />
Which hurt him little, if at all:<br />
So merrily along we go,                                     <span class="linenum">470</span><br />
And reach that famous town by two.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span><br />
<i>Queenborough</i> consists of one short street,<a name="FNanchor_7_338" id="FNanchor_7_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_338" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br />
Broad, and well-pav'd, and very neat;<br />
Nothing like dirt offends the eye,<br />
Scarce any people could we spy:                             <span class="linenum">475</span><br />
The town-house, for the better show,<br />
Is mounted on a portico<br />
Of piers and arches, number four,<br />
And crown'd at top with a clock-tower;<br />
But all this did not reach so high                          <span class="linenum">480</span><br />
As a flag-staff, that stood just by,<br />
On which a standard huge was flying<br />
(The borough's arms, the king's supplying),<br />
Which on high festivals they display<br />
To do the honours of the day.                               <span class="linenum">485</span><br />
As for salutes, excus'd they are,<br />
Because they have no cannon there.<br />
<br />
To the church-yard we first repair,<br />
And hunt for choice inscriptions there,<br />
Search stones and rails, till almost weary all,             <span class="linenum">490</span><br />
In hopes to find something material.<br />
When one at last, of pyebald style<br />
(Though grave the subject) made us smile:<br />
Telling us first, in humble prose,<br />
"That <i>Henry Knight</i> doth here repose,                 <span class="linenum">495</span><br />
A <i>Greenland</i> Trader twice twelve year,<br />
As master and as harpooneer;"<br />
Then, in as humble verse, we read<br />
(As by himself in person said)<br />
"In <i>Greenland</i> I whales, sea-horse, and bears did slay,    <span class="linenum">500</span><br />
Though now my body is intombed in clay."<br />
<br />
The house at which we were to quarter<br />
Is call'd <i>The Swans</i>; this rais'd our laughter.<br />
Because the sign is <i>The Red Lion</i>,<br />
So strange a blunder we cry "Fie on!"                       <span class="linenum">505</span><br />
But, going in, all neat we see<br />
And clean; so was our landlady:<br />
With great civility she told us,<br />
She had not beds enough to hold us,<br />
But a good neighbour had just by,                           <span class="linenum">510</span><br />
Where some of us perhaps might lie.<br />
She sends to ask. The merry dame<br />
Away to us directly came,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>Quite ready our desires to grant,<br />
And furnish us with what we want.                           <span class="linenum">515</span><br />
<br />
Back to the church again we go;<br />
Which is but small, ill built, and low,<br />
View'd the inside, but still see we<br />
Nothing of curiosity<br />
Unless we suffer the grave-digger                           <span class="linenum">520</span><br />
In this our work to make a figure,<br />
Whom just beside us now we have,<br />
Employ'd in opening of a grave.<br />
<br />
A prating spark indeed he was,<br />
Knew all the scandal of the place,                          <span class="linenum">525</span><br />
And often rested from his labours,<br />
To give the history of his neighbours;<br />
Told who was who, and what was what,<br />
Till on him we bestow'd a pot<br />
(For he forgot not, you may think,                          <span class="linenum">530</span><br />
"Masters, I hope, you'll make me drink!"),<br />
At this his scurrilous tongue run faster,<br />
Till "a sad dog" he call'd his master,<br />
Told us the worshipful the Mayor<br />
Was but a custom-house officer;                             <span class="linenum">535</span><br />
Still rattling on till we departed,<br />
Not only with his tales diverted,<br />
But so much wisdom we had got.<br />
We treated him with t'other pot.<br />
<br />
Return we now to the town-hall.                             <span class="linenum">540</span><br />
That, like the borough, is but small,<br />
Under its portico's a space,<br />
Which you may call the market-place,<br />
Just big enough to hold the stocks,<br />
And one, if not two, butcher's blocks,                      <span class="linenum">545</span><br />
Emblems of plenty and excess,<br />
Though you can no where meet with less:<br />
For though 'tis call'd a market-town<br />
(As they are not asham'd to own)<br />
Yet we saw neither butcher's meat,                          <span class="linenum">550</span><br />
Nor fish, nor fowl, nor aught to eat.<br />
Once in seven years, they say, there's plenty,<br />
When strangers come to represent ye.<br />
<br />
Hard at <i>The Swans</i> had been our fare,<br />
But that some <i>Harwich</i> men were there,                <span class="linenum">555</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>Who lately had some lobsters taken,<br />
With which, and eke some eggs and bacon,<br />
Our bellies we design to fill;<br />
But first will clamber up the hill,<br />
A most delightful spot of ground,                           <span class="linenum">560</span><br />
O'erlooking all the country round;<br />
On which there formerly has been<br />
The palace of <i>Philippa</i>, queen<br />
To the third <i>Edward</i>, as they tell,<br />
Now nought remains on 't but a well:                        <span class="linenum">565</span><br />
But 'tis from hence, says common fame,<br />
The borough gets its royal name.<br />
<br />
Two sailors at this well we meet,<br />
And do each other kindly greet:<br />
"What brings you here, my lads?" cry we.                    <span class="linenum">570</span><br />
"Thirst, please your honours, as you see;<br />
For (adds the spokesman) we are here<br />
Waiting for our young officer,<br />
A midshipman on board <i>The Rose</i>,<br />
(For General <i>S&mdash;&mdash;'s</i> son he goes):                   <span class="linenum">575</span><br />
We and our messmates, six in all,<br />
Yesterday brought him in our yawl,<br />
And when, as we had been commanded,<br />
Quite safe and dry we had him landed,<br />
By running of her fast aground                              <span class="linenum">580</span><br />
At tide of ebb, he quickly found<br />
That he might go and see <i>Sheerness</i>,<br />
So here he left us pennyless,<br />
To feast on <i>Queenborough</i> air and water,<br />
Or starve, to him 'tis no great matter;                     <span class="linenum">585</span><br />
While he among his friends at ease is,<br />
And will return just when he pleases;<br />
Perhaps he may come back to-day;<br />
If not, he knows that we must stay."<br />
<br />
So one of us gave him a tester,                             <span class="linenum">590</span><br />
When both cried out, "God bless you, master!"<br />
Then ran to rouse their sleeping fellows,<br />
To share their fortune at the alehouse.<br />
<br />
Hence to the creek-side, one and all,<br />
We go to see <i>The Rose's</i> yawl,                        <span class="linenum">595</span><br />
And found her bedded in the mud,<br />
Immovable till tide of flood.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span><br />
The sailors here had cockles got,<br />
Which gratefully to us they brought,<br />
'Twas all with which they could regale us;                  <span class="linenum">600</span><br />
This t'other sixpence sent to th' alehouse:<br />
So merrily they went their way,<br />
And we were no less pleas'd than they.<br />
<br />
At seven about the town we walk,<br />
And with some pretty damsels talk.                          <span class="linenum">605</span><br />
Beautiful nymphs indeed, I ween,<br />
Who came to see, and to be seen.<br />
<br />
Then to our <i>Swans</i> returning, there<br />
We borrow'd a great wooden chair,<br />
And plac'd it in the open street,                           <span class="linenum">610</span><br />
Where, in much state, did <i>Hogarth</i> sit<br />
To draw the townhouse, church, and steeple,<a name="FNanchor_8_339" id="FNanchor_8_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_339" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br />
Surrounded by a crowd of people;<br />
Tag, rag, and bobtail, stood quite thick there,<br />
And cry'd, "What a sweet pretty picture!"                   <span class="linenum">615</span><br />
<br />
This was not finish'd long, before<br />
We saw, about the Mayor's fore-door,<br />
Our honest sailors in a throng:<br />
We call'd one of them from among<br />
The rest, to tell us the occasion;                          <span class="linenum">620</span><br />
Of which he gave us this relation:<br />
<br />
"Our midshipman is just come back,<br />
And chanc'd to meet or overtake<br />
A sailor walking with a woman<br />
(May be, she's honest, may be, common):                     <span class="linenum">625</span><br />
He thought her handsome, so his honour<br />
Would needs be very sweet upon her:<br />
But this the seaman would not suf-<br />
fer, and this put him in a huff.<br />
'Lubber, avast,' says sturdy <i>John</i>,                   <span class="linenum">630</span><br />
'Avast, I say, let her alone;<br />
You shall not board her, she's my wife.<br />
Sheer off, Sir, if you love your life:<br />
I've a great mind your back to lick;'<br />
And up he held his oaken stick.                             <span class="linenum">635</span><br />
<br />
"Our midship hero this did scare:<br />
'I'll swear the peace before the Mayor,'<br />
Says he; so to the Mayor's they trudge:"<br />
How then a case by such a judge<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>Determin'd was, I cannot say,                              <span class="linenum">640</span><br />
We thought it not worth while to stay:<br />
For it strikes nine, "How th' evening spends!<br />
Come, let us drink to all our friends<br />
A chearful glass, and eat a bit."<br />
So to our supper down we sit;                              <span class="linenum">645</span><br />
When something merry check'd our mirth:<br />
The <i>Harwich</i> men had got a birth<br />
Closely adjoining to our room,<br />
And were to spend their evening come:<br />
The wall was thin, and they so near,                       <span class="linenum">650</span><br />
That all they say, or sing, we hear.<br />
We sung our songs, we crack'd our jokes,<br />
Their emulation this provokes;<br />
And they perform'd so joyously,<br />
As distanc'd hollow all our glee;                          <span class="linenum">655</span><br />
So (were it not a bull) I'd lay,<br />
This night they fairly won the day.<br />
<br />
Now plenteously we drink of flip,<br />
In hopes we shall the better sleep;<br />
Some rest the long day's work requires;                    <span class="linenum">660</span><br />
<i>Scott</i> to his lodging first retires;<br />
His landlady is waiting for him,<br />
And to his chamber walks before him;<br />
In her fair hand a light she bears,<br />
And shows him up the garret-stairs;                        <span class="linenum">665</span><br />
Away comes he greatly affronted,<br />
And his disgrace to us recounted.<br />
This makes us game, we roast him for it,<br />
"<i>Scott's</i> too high-minded for a garret."<br />
But <i>Tothall</i> more humanely said,                     <span class="linenum">670</span><br />
"Come, <i>Scott</i>, be easy, take my bed,<br />
And to your garret I will go."<br />
(This great good-nature sure did show):<br />
There finding nought him to entertain<br />
But a flock-bed without a curtain,                         <span class="linenum">675</span><br />
He too in haste came back, and got<br />
Away to share his bed with <i>Scott</i>,<br />
And at eleven each goes to nest,<br />
Till <i>Tuesday</i> morn to take his rest.<br />
<br />
At six comes <i>Hogarth</i>, "Rise, Sirs, rise,"           <span class="linenum">680</span><br />
Says he, with roguery in his eyes,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>"<i>Scott's</i> landlady is below stairs.<br />
And roundly the good woman swears,<br />
That for his lodging he shall pay,<br />
(Where his tir'd bones he scorn'd to lay)                  <span class="linenum">685</span><br />
Or he should go before the Mayor."<br />
She's in the right on't, we declare,<br />
For this would cut the matter short,<br />
(At least 'twould make us special sport):<br />
But here she balk'd us, and, no doubt,                     <span class="linenum">690</span><br />
Had wit enough to find us out.<br />
Our mark thus miss'd, we kindly go,<br />
To see how he and <i>Tothall</i> do.<br />
We find the doors all open were,<br />
(It seems that's not unusual here):                        <span class="linenum">695</span><br />
They're very well, but <i>Scott</i> last night<br />
Had been in a most dreadful fright:<br />
"When to his room he got," he said,<br />
"And just was stepping into bed,<br />
He thought he saw the bed-cloaths stir,                    <span class="linenum">700</span><br />
So back he flew in mortal fear;<br />
But taking heart of grace, he try'd<br />
To feel what 'twas, when out it cry'd<br />
Again he starts, but to his joy,<br />
It prov'd a little harmless boy,                           <span class="linenum">705</span><br />
Who by mistake had thither crept,<br />
And soundly (till he wak'd him) slept<br />
So from his fears recover'd quite<br />
He got to sleep, and slept all night."<br />
We laugh at this, and he laughs too,                       <span class="linenum">710</span><br />
For, pray, what better could he do?<br />
<br />
At ten we leave our <i>Lion-Swans</i>,<br />
And to the higher lands advance,<br />
Call on our laundress by the way,<br />
For the led shirts left yesterday                          <span class="linenum">715</span><br />
To wash; "She's sorry, they're not yet<br />
Quite dry!"&mdash;"Why then we'll take them wet:<br />
They'll dry and iron'd be, we hope,<br />
At <i>Minster</i>, where we next shall stop."<br />
<br />
The way was good, the weather fair,                        <span class="linenum">720</span><br />
The prospects most delightful were.<br />
To <i>Minster</i> got, with labour hard<br />
We climb'd the hill to the church-yard,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>But, when arriv'd there, did not fail<br />
To read some verses on a rail                              <span class="linenum">725</span><br />
Well worth transcribing, we agree,<br />
Whether you think so, you may see.<br />
"Here interr'd <i>George Anderson</i> doth lye,<br />
By fallen on an anchor he did dye<br />
In <i>Sheerness</i> yard on <i>Good Friday</i>             <span class="linenum">730</span><br />
The 6th of <i>April</i>, I do say.<br />
All you that read my allegy be alwaies<br />
Ready for to dye&mdash;aged 42 years."<br />
<br />
Of monuments that here they shew<br />
Within the church, we drew but two;                        <span class="linenum">735</span><br />
One an ambassador of <i>Spain's</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_340" id="FNanchor_9_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_340" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br />
T' other Lord <i>Shorland's</i><a name="FNanchor_10_341" id="FNanchor_10_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_341" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> dust contains,<br />
Of whom they have a wondrous story,<br />
Which (as they tell) I'll lay before ye.<br />
<br />
The Lord of <i>Shorland</i>, on a day,<a name="FNanchor_11_342" id="FNanchor_11_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_342" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>                 <span class="linenum">740</span><br />
Chancing to take a ride this way,<br />
About a corpse observ'd a crowd,<br />
Against their priest complaining loud,<br />
That he would not the service say,<br />
Till somebody his fees should pay.                         <span class="linenum">745</span><br />
<br />
On this, his lordship too did rave,<br />
And threw the priest into the grave,<br />
"Make haste, and fill it up," said he,<br />
"We'll bury both without a fee."<br />
But when got home, and cool, reflecting                    <span class="linenum">750</span><br />
On the strange part he had been acting,<br />
He drew a state up of the case,<br />
Humbly petitioning for grace,<br />
And to the sea gallop'd away,<br />
Where, at that time, a frigate lay,                        <span class="linenum">755</span><br />
With Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> on board,<br />
When (strange to tell!) this hare-brain'd Lord<br />
On horseback swam to the ship's side,<br />
And there to see the Queen apply'd.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>His case she reads; her royal breast                       <span class="linenum">760</span><br />
Is mov'd to grant him his request.<br />
His pardon thankfully he takes,<br />
And, swimming still, to land he makes:<br />
But, on his riding up the beach,<br />
He an old woman met, a witch:                              <span class="linenum">765</span><br />
"This horse, which now your life doth save,"<br />
Says she, "will bring you to the grave."<br />
"You'll prove a lier," says my lord,<br />
"You ugly hag!" and with his sword<br />
(Acting a most ungrateful part)                            <span class="linenum">770</span><br />
His panting steed stabb'd to the heart.<br />
<br />
It happen'd, after many a day,<br />
That with some friends he stroll'd that way,<br />
And this strange story, as they walk,<br />
Became the subject of their talk:                          <span class="linenum">775</span><br />
When, "There the carcase lies," he cry'd,<br />
"Upon the beach by the sea-side."<br />
As 'twas not far, he led them to't,<br />
And kick'd the skull up with his foot,<br />
When a sharp bone pierc'd through his shoe,                <span class="linenum">780</span><br />
And wounded grievously his toe,<br />
Which mortify'd: so he was kill'd,<br />
And the hag's prophecy fulfill'd.<br />
See there his cross-legg'd figure laid,<br />
And near his feet the horse's head!<a name="FNanchor_12_343" id="FNanchor_12_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_343" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>                    <span class="linenum">785</span><br />
<br />
The tomb<a name="FNanchor_13_344" id="FNanchor_13_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_344" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> is of too old a fashion<br />
To tally well with this narration;<br />
But of the truth we would not doubt,<br />
Nor put our <i>Cicerone</i> out:<br />
It gives a moral hint at least,                            <span class="linenum">790</span><br />
That gratitude's due to a beast.<br />
So far it's good, whoever made it,<br />
And that it may not fail of credit,<br />
A horsehead vane adorns the steeple,<br />
And it's <i>Horse-church</i> call'd by the people.         <span class="linenum">795</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span><br />
Our shirts dry'd at <i>The George</i> we get,<br />
We dine there, and till four we sit;<br />
And now in earnest think of home:<br />
So to <i>Sheerness</i> again we come.<br />
Where for a bum-boat we agree,                             <span class="linenum">800</span><br />
And about five put off to sea.<br />
We presently were under sail,<br />
The tide our friend, south-east the gale,<br />
Quite wind enough, and some to spare,<br />
But we to that accustom'd were.                            <span class="linenum">805</span><br />
<br />
When we had now got past <i>The Nore</i>,<br />
And lost the sight of <i>Shepey's</i> shore,<br />
The ebbing tide of <i>Thames</i> we met,<br />
The wind against it fiercely set!<br />
This made a short and tumbling sea,                        <span class="linenum">810</span><br />
And finely toss'd indeed were we.<br />
<br />
The porpoises in stormy weather<br />
Are often seen in shoals together;<br />
About us while they roll and play,<br />
One in his gambols miss'd his way,                         <span class="linenum">815</span><br />
And threw himself so far on shore,<br />
We thought he would get off no more;<br />
But with great struggling and some pain,<br />
He did, and went to play again.<br />
On this we moralising say,                                 <span class="linenum">820</span><br />
"How thoughtless is the love of play!"<br />
When we ourselves with sorrow find<br />
Our pleasures too with pain conjoin'd.<br />
For troubles croud upon us thick;<br />
Our hero, <i>Scott</i>, grows very sick;                   <span class="linenum">825</span><br />
Poor <i>Hogarth</i> makes wry faces too<br />
(Worse faces than he ever drew).<br />
You'll guess what were the consequences,<br />
Not overpleasing to our senses;<br />
And this misfortune was augmented                          <span class="linenum">830</span><br />
By Master <i>Tothall's</i> being acquainted<br />
With the commander of a sloop,<br />
At <i>Holy Haven</i> near <i>The Hope</i>.<br />
"There's Captain <i>Robinson</i>," says he,<br />
"A friend, whom I must call and see."                      <span class="linenum">835</span><br />
Up the ship's side he nimbly goes,<br />
While we lay overwhelm'd with woes<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>Sick, and of winds and waves the sport.<br />
But then he made his visit short,<br />
And when a sup of punch he'd got,                          <span class="linenum">840</span><br />
Some lighted match to us he brought,<br />
A sovereign cordial this, no doubt,<br />
To men whose pipes had long been out.<br />
<br />
By seven o'clock our sick recover,<br />
And all are glad this trouble's over.                      <span class="linenum">845</span><br />
Now jovially we sail along,<br />
Our cockswain giving song for song.<br />
But soon our notes are chang'd; we found<br />
Our boat was on <i>Bly-sand</i> aground,<br />
Just in the middle of the river;                           <span class="linenum">850</span><br />
Here <i>Tothall</i> shew'd himself quite clever:<br />
And, knowing we must else abide<br />
Till lifted by the flowing tide,<br />
Work'd with our skippers, till the boat<br />
Was once more happily afloat.                              <span class="linenum">855</span><br />
We all applaud his care and skill,<br />
So do the boatmen his good-will.<br />
<br />
Ere long the tide made upward, so<br />
With that before the wind we go,<br />
And, disembarking about ten,                               <span class="linenum">860</span><br />
Our <i>Gravesend</i> quarters reach again.<br />
<br />
Here Madam, smiling, comes to tell<br />
How glad she is to see us well:<br />
This kind reception we commended,<br />
And now thought all our troubles ended;                    <span class="linenum">865</span><br />
But, when for what we want we call,<br />
Something unlucky did befall.<br />
<br />
When we our travels first began<br />
<i>Scott</i> (who's a very prudent man)<br />
Thought a great coat could do no harm,                     <span class="linenum">870</span><br />
And in the boat might keep him warm;<br />
So far perhaps you think him right,<br />
As we took water in the night:<br />
But when from hence we took our way<br />
On foot, the latter end of <i>May</i>,                     <span class="linenum">875</span><br />
He, quite as reasonably, thought<br />
'Twould be too heavy or too hot:<br />
"I'll leave it here," says he, "and take<br />
It with me at our coming back."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>And he most certainly design'd it:                         <span class="linenum">880</span><br />
But now the thing was, how to find it?<br />
<br />
We told him, he had been mistaken,<br />
And did without his hostess reckon.<br />
To him it was no jest; he swore<br />
"He left it there three days before,                       <span class="linenum">885</span><br />
This Mrs. <i>Bramble</i> can't deny."<br />
"Sir, we shall find it by and by:"<br />
So out she goes, and rends her throat<br />
With "<i>Moll</i>, go find the gem'man's coat."<br />
The house <i>Moll</i> searches round and round,            <span class="linenum">890</span><br />
At last, with much ado, 'twas found&mdash;<br />
'Twas found, that, to the owner's cost,<br />
Or <i>Scott's</i>, the borrow'd coat was lost.<br />
"Coat lost!" says he, stamping and staring,<br />
Then stood like dumb, then fell to swearing:               <span class="linenum">895</span><br />
He curs'd the ill-concluding ramble,<br />
He curs'd <i>Gravesend</i> and mother <i>Bramble</i>.<br />
<br />
But, while his rage he thus express'd,<br />
And we his anger made our jest,<br />
Till wrath had almost got the upper-                       <span class="linenum">900</span><br />
hand of his reason, in came supper:<br />
To this at once his stomach turn'd,<br />
No longer it with fury burn'd,<br />
But hunger took the place of rage,<br />
And a good meal did both assuage.                          <span class="linenum">905</span><br />
He eat and drank, he drank and eat,<br />
The wine commended, and the meat:<br />
So we did all, and sat so late,<br />
That <i>Wednesday</i> morn we lay till eight.<br />
Tobacco then, and wine provide,                            <span class="linenum">910</span><br />
Enough to serve us for this tide.<br />
Get breakfast, and our reckoning pay,<br />
And next prepare for <i>London</i> hey;<br />
So, hiring to ourselves a wherry,<br />
We put off, all alive and merry.                           <span class="linenum">915</span><br />
<br />
The tide was strong, fair was the wind,<br />
<i>Gravesend</i> is soon left far behind,<br />
Under the tilt on straw we lay,<br />
Observing what a charming day,<br />
There stretch'd at ease we smoke and drink,                <span class="linenum">920</span><br />
<i>Londoners</i> like, and now we think<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>Our cross adventures all are past,<br />
And that at <i>Gravesend</i> was the last:<br />
But cruel Fate to that says no;<br />
One yet shall Fortune find his foe.                        <span class="linenum">925</span><br />
<br />
While we (with various prospects cloy'd)<br />
In clouds of smoke ourselves enjoy'd,<br />
More diligent and curious, <i>Scott</i><br />
Into the forecastle had got,<br />
And took his papers out, to draw                           <span class="linenum">930</span><br />
Some ships which right ahead he saw.<br />
There sat he, on his work intent,<br />
When, to increase our merriment,<br />
So luckily we shipp'd a sea,<br />
That he got sous'd, and only he.                           <span class="linenum">935</span><br />
This bringing to his mind a thought<br />
How much he wanted the great coat,<br />
Renew'd his anger and his grief;<br />
He curs'd <i>Gravesend</i>, the coat, and thief;<br />
And, still to heighten his regret,                         <span class="linenum">940</span><br />
His shirt was in his breeches wet:<br />
He draws it out, and lets it fly,<br />
Like a <i>French</i> ensign, till 'tis dry,<br />
Then, creeping into shelter safe,<br />
Joins with the company and laugh.                          <span class="linenum">945</span><br />
Nothing more happen'd worthy note:<br />
<br />
At <i>Billingsgate</i> we change our boat,<br />
And in another through bridge get,<br />
By two, to Stairs of <i>Somerset</i>,<br />
Welcome each other to the shore,                           <span class="linenum">950</span><br />
To <i>Convent Garden</i> walk once more,<br />
And, as from <i>Bedford Arms</i> we started,<br />
There wet our whistles ere we parted.<br />
<br />
With pleasure I observe, none idle<br />
Were in our travels, or employ'd ill,                      <span class="linenum">955</span><br />
<i>Tottall</i>, our treasurer, was just,<br />
And worthily discharg'd his trust;<br />
(We all sign'd his accounts as fair):<br />
<i>Sam Scott</i> and <i>Hogarth</i>, for their share,<br />
The prospects of the sea and land did;                     <span class="linenum">960</span><br />
As <i>Thornhill</i> of our tour the plan did;<br />
And <i>Forrest</i> wrote this true relation<br />
Of our five days peregrination.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This to attest, our names we've wrote all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Viz. <i>Thornhill, Hogarth, Scott</i>, and <i>Tothall</i>. <span class="linenum">965</span></span><br />

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
